# Rights and Permissions

This repository preserves and describes a historical philosophical archive.

## Scope

The corpus includes:

- Author-supplied manuscripts, correspondence, production files, and visual artifacts in `undo-uus-archive/*`.
- Curator-authored metadata, documentation, scripts, and generated markdown mirrors.

## Rights Status (Known / Unknown)

- `undo-uus-archive/_IMPERATIVE_Article/_TheLibertarianImperative.pdf` and cover images:
  copyright likely involves publisher and/or author rights; no explicit license statement is currently embedded in this repository.
- `undo-uus-archive/_IMPERATIVE_Article/PublishingProcess/*` and `undo-uus-archive/_IMPERATIVE_Responses/*`:
  includes correspondence and third-party commentary; rights may be distributed across multiple authors/rights-holders.
- Curator-created files (docs/scripts/manifests in this repository):
  rights held by repository curator/contributors unless otherwise stated.

## Use Guidance

Until explicit licenses are documented per artifact class, treat source artifacts as **all rights reserved unless applicable law provides an exception**.

Conservative allowed uses:

- local/private research and reading
- short quotations with attribution under applicable quotation/fair-use/fair-dealing rules
- archival integrity checking (checksums/manifests)

Potentially restricted without permission:

- broad redistribution of source artifacts
- commercial reuse
- derivative republication of full texts/images

## OCR / Derived Markdown Text

`markdown-mirror/*` files are derived readability mirrors of source artifacts. They improve access but do not imply independent rights to redistribute underlying content.

## Custody vs Rights

Archival custody/preservation does not itself grant copyright ownership.

## Takedown / Rights Contact

If you are a rights-holder and have concerns, open a repository issue requesting review and include:

- artifact path(s)
- claimed rights basis
- requested action (restrict/remove/correct attribution)

The curator will review and respond with a preservation-conscious resolution path.
