# PublishingProcess

Original records of manuscript development and publication workflow.

## Sequence

- `1a` to `3a`: pre-submission and early editorial shaping.
- `4a`: referee critique and constraints.
- `4b` to `5c`: argument tightening and late revisions.
- `6a` to `6h`: acceptance, production transfer, proofs, and publication logistics.
- `6f`: parallel commissioned book review output.

## Core Draft Spine

`1b -> 2b -> 3b -> 4b -> 5b -> 6b/6d`

Use this as the main textual evolution path, and interleave the publishing correspondence files to understand the rationale for each change.
