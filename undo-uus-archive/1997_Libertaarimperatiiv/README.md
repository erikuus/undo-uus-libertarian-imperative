# 1997_Libertaarimperatiiv (Estonian Publication, Secondary)

This folder preserves a **secondary-language** publication context for the core argument:
an Estonian-language presentation of the Libertarian Imperative published in *Akadeemia*.

The **canonical, primary reading path** for the argument in this archive remains the English article corpus under:

- `../_IMPERATIVE_Article/_TheLibertarianImperative.pdf`
- `../_IMPERATIVE_Article/PublishingProcess/` (draft + editorial spine)

## Contents

- `Akadeemia_1997_10_0001.pdf`: full issue scan (includes many non-archive articles). Preserved as a canonical artifact but intentionally **not mirrored** to markdown.
- `_Libertaarimperatiiv.pdf`: Estonian-language core text as preserved in this archive.
- `EnglishSummary.pdf`: English summary provided alongside the Estonian publication package.
- `EditorialNote.pdf`: editorial note as preserved in the publication package.
- `Yleskutse.pdf`: related appeal/call text (Estonian).

## Preservation Notes

- Original files in this folder are preserved as-is.
- Fixity for canonical artifacts is recorded in `../manifest-sha256.txt`.
- Readability-first markdown mirrors (including OCR when applicable) are generated under:
  `../../markdown-mirror/undo-uus-archive/1997_Libertaarimperatiiv/`.
- Human-edited reader editions (including an English translation) live under:
  `../../markdown-reader/undo-uus-archive/1997_Libertaarimperatiiv/`.
- For this Estonian corpus, mirrors also apply a small, explicit repair pass to correct a common PDF/DOCX extraction artifact where diacritics appear as separate characters (e.g. `¨U`/`U¨` → `Ü`, `˜o`/`o˜` → `õ`). This changes representation only, not meaning, and is tracked in mirror headers.
