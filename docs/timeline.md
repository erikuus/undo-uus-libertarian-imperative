## Draft Evolution Spine

The doctrinal text evolves along this main chain:

`1b -> 2b -> 3b -> 4b -> 5b -> 5c -> 6b/6d -> final published PDF`

Signals across revisions:

- Title narrows from a broader consciousness-focused phrasing to **The Libertarian Imperative**.
- Editorial pressure removes polemical sections and tightens argument structure.
- Later versions sharpen distinctions from related wager-style reasoning.

## How To Read The Timeline Efficiently

1. Read the final article first.
2. Walk backward through `6b/6d`, `5b`, `4b`, `3b`, `2b`, `1b`.
3. At each step, read corresponding `*publishing*` letters for causal context.
4. End with responses dossier to see uptake and misreadings.
