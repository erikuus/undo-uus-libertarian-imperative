# Concept And Originality

## Core Thesis

The Libertarian Imperative is not presented only as a metaphysical statement about what humans are. It is a practical directive for how one should orient action and belief:

1. If genuine free will exists, acting as a free agent is correct.
2. If it does not exist and behavior is law-governed, then acting as free could not have been avoided.
3. So one should proceed by trying to act as free.

This yields a decision stance that survives both horns of the free-will dilemma.

## Core Conceptual Blocks

- Consciousness versus strict materialism.
- Rejection of epiphenomenal consciousness as research-deadening.
- Nomological (law-governed) causality and its explanatory limits.
- Free will as a methodological imperative for inquiry and conduct.
- Distinction from Pascal's Wager and from a purely pragmatic belief gamble.

## Why The Argument Is Highly Original

- It relocates the free-will issue from "what exists" to "how we must proceed under uncertainty."
- It treats the imperative as logic-driven and action-guiding, not as a moral slogan.
- It directly binds philosophy of mind and agency methodology in one argument.

## Why It Remains Relevant In Any Period

- The conflict between first-person agency and third-person science persists.
- Debates on AI, neuroscience, and predictive behavior models keep renewing determinism pressures.
- The imperative provides a stable operational stance even when theoretical consensus is absent.
