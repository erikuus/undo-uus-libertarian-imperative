## Plain-Language Thesis

The Libertarian Imperative says that when deciding how to act under uncertainty about free will, the most rational stance is to try to act as a genuinely free agent: if free will is real, this is correct; if behavior is fully law-governed, then acting this way could not have been avoided anyway.

## Premises to Conclusion

1. You face a live uncertainty: are your actions genuinely free (incompatibilist sense) or fully law-governed?
2. If genuine free will exists, acting as free aligns with reality.
3. If behavior is fully law-governed, then your acting-as-free cannot be blamed as avoidable error.
4. Therefore the practical policy that survives both cases is: try to act as free.

## What "Act As Free" Means

- It does mean treating your agency as methodologically serious in inquiry and conduct.
- It does mean resisting reduction of all deliberation to passive law-following assumptions.
- It does **not** mean claiming a completed metaphysical proof of free will.
- It does **not** mean denying empirical science.

## Common Confusions

- "Is this Pascal's Wager?"
  No. The core move is not payoff calculation but a structural claim about rational action under agency uncertainty.
- "Is this William James's will-to-believe?"
  Related in spirit about live options, but here the emphasis is on an action-guiding imperative framed as logically robust under both horns.
- "Is this a moral imperative only?"
  Primarily methodological/practical in argument form, though it can have ethical implications.
- "Does this prove incompatibilism true?"
  No. It argues for a stable action stance, not a final metaphysical settlement.
