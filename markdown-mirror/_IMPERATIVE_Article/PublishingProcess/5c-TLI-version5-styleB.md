THE LIBERTARIAN IMPERATIVE
Undo Uus*
Abstract: The prevailing trend of deeming subjective experiences causally idle
obfuscates consciousness research as epiphenomenal entities cannot be studied.
The most ﬂexible way for conscious experiences to be eﬃcacious is for them to
serve as a basis for free action. Regrettably, no objective evidence testiﬁes for this
possibility. In this paper I shall explain that if we seek the truth we must, for
purely logical reasons, irrespective of theoretical ideas and empirical data about
the origin of our activity, follow the Libertarian Imperative — the demand to try
always to act in accord with the belief that one exercises the incompatibilist free
volition. The Libertarian Imperative urges us to try to reject any conception about
our nature — including the modern scientiﬁc picture of human beings — which
claims that we are entirely law-governed creatures.
Our epistemic situation is agonising. On one hand, scientiﬁc observations strongly sug-
gest that the world is thoroughly physical — a huge material system that ultimately
consists of relatively simple fundamental physical entities which obey deterministic or
probabilistic laws of dynamics. On the other hand, we are subjectively aware of un-
dergoing phenomenal experiences and of being free originative agents. But phenomenal
consciousness and genuine, incompatibilist free volition have no place in the physical-
istic world picture, and, given the immense theoretical and technical achievements of
modern materialistic sciences, there is a tremendous psychological pressure to deny their
existence. It is no wonder that the scholarly community has almost entirely succumbed
to this pressure. Fortunately, the darkest years of dominance by radical materialism are
over and the issue of consciousness has begun to attract the attention it deserves.
The Tangled Rehabilitation of Consciousness
Although hardly anybody denies the existence of consciousness these days, many philoso-
phers try to explain it away by redeﬁning it in purely physicalistic formal-structural
terms (see Churchland, 1995; Dennett, 1991; Hardcastle, 1995). However, there is
an insuperable obstacle to these aspirations: the phenomenal qualitative character or
qualia of conscious experiences. The attempts to treat qualia in the language of ortho-
dox physics are utterly unconvincing and doomed to failure because qualia — including

the most general quale experientialness or something-it-is-like-to-be-ness which is in-
herent to every phenomenon of consciousness — and the formal-structural concepts of
physics — whether about simple or extremely complicated systems and processes —
belong to entirely diﬀerent categories. For that reason ever more philosophers admit
that the phenomenon which has been traditionally called consciousness and is now of-
ten called phenomenal consciousness does not ﬁt into the strictly physicalistic world
scheme (see, e.g., Searle, 1992; Chalmers, 1995, 1996). They suppose that phenomenal
consciousness is either like some sort of ‘ﬁeld’ — the ﬁeld of phenomenal experience
— which exists over and above the physical ﬁelds and particles (see Libet, 1994), or it
is the intrinsic qualitative essence of physical entities themselves, as panpsychists have
always suggested (see Griﬃn, 1997). Both these positions amount to the abandoning of
the belief that the world is ontologically thoroughly physical in the traditional sense.
Regrettably, the rehabilitation of consciousness has become tangled as the majority
of scholars who acknowledge the existence of phenomenal experiences try, nevertheless,
to save the most basic doctrine of the materialist world concept: they hold that the
physically lawful dynamics of the material world is not disturbed by the nonphysical
constituents and properties of reality. By assuming that the physical domain is causally
autonomous, the causal behaviour of the physical world is theoretically safeguarded
from any ‘marring’ impact from the extraphysical. Moreover, the physical domain is
considered to be not only causally autonomous but also causally suﬃcient: it is held
that the physical determines not only its own dynamics but also the entire existence
of the nonphysical. Though the world is allowed to be ontologically heterogeneous, its
causal thread is believed to be homogeneous — completely physical.
The idea of epiphenomenal consciousness
The view that the nonphysical exists but is determined by the physical implies that
consciousness is causally impotent. The thesis of the epiphenomenality of consciousness
is explicitly advocated, e.g., by Frank Jackson (1982), David Lewis (1995) and David
Chalmers (1995, 1996).
The epiphenomenalist theories of consciousness have been criticised by several au-
thors (see Beloﬀ, 1994; Elitzur, 1995; Hodgson, 1994, 1996; Lowe, 1995; Warner, 1996),
most forcefully by Daniel Dennett (1991, pp. 398–406). The fatal defect of theories of
epiphenomena is that they cut themselves oﬀ from any empirical basis. The fact-based
theories of epiphenomena are impossible for logical reasons.
It is logically possible that our subjective experiences are causally inert. There is
also nothing counterlogical in advancing a theory that we actually have certain epiphe-
nomenal experiences. It can even be agreed that everyone of us knows that this theory
2

is correct, because everyone of us is necessarily aware of one’s own experiences (Lowe,
1996, p. 190). But it is illogical to claim that this kind of consciousness can serve as an
empirical basis for our theoretical speculations about it, or that we can make reports of
evidential value about the existence and content of such a consciousness. A defender of
epiphenomenal consciousness is justiﬁed to contend, as Chalmers (1996, p. 198) does: I
know I am conscious, and the knowledge is based solely on my immediate experience.
To say that the experience makes no diﬀerence to my psychological functioning is not
to say that the experience makes no diﬀerence to me. But, on pain of self-contradiction,
he cannot assure us that he asserts he knows he is conscious because he knows he is
conscious. He has to concede that according to his own views his statement has been
produced by his psychological (neurophysiological) functioning no matter whether he in
fact knows he is conscious.
The belief in the autonomy of the physical world spoils the endeavours to rehabili-
tate phenomenal consciousness. If a champion of phenomenal experiences believes in the
causal suﬃciency of physics, he must hold that the experiences are causally idle, and in
doing so, he exposes himself to ridicule by his physicalist adversaries and strips the prob-
lem of phenomenal consciousness of any scientiﬁc import. If one argues like Chalmers
(1995) that there is the really hard problem of experiences but that explaining (i) the
access to one’s own internal states, (ii) the production of reports about mental events,
and (iii) the deliberate control of behaviour are all easy problems concerning only the
neurophysiological mechanisms and processes, one falls an easy prey to his physicalist
opponents who use an indefeasible logical argument to force him to admit that (i) the
‘really hard problem’ is, in fact, merely one of the ‘easy’ problems, since the reason why
the intellectual wrestling with the ‘hard problem’ arises and leads to deﬁnite conclusions
can be explained ‘easily’ as being the result of the neurophysiological processes alone,
and that therefore (ii) the concept of epiphenomenal experiences presents only as neg-
ligible an interest to sciences as a hypothesis about the physical ﬁelds which surround
material particles but exert no impact on anything.
The proponents of phenomenal consciousness hold overwhelmingly to the view that
the nonphysical is causally idle, and for that reason most of the modern theories of
phenomenal consciousness are demolished by materialists before they really get oﬀ the
ground. The philosophy of consciousness is in a stalemate.
Can There Be a Science of Phenomenal Consciousness?
From what has been said above it should be clear that any fact-based theory of phenom-
enal consciousness is incompatible with the doctrine of the causal closure of the physical
universe as we know it. The empirically grounded science of phenomenal consciousness
3

is possible only if the physical world as conceptualised by modern materialistic philos-
ophy is causally open. This proposition must be regarded as the cornerstone of any
logically sound philosophy of phenomenal consciousness.
Those who assume that the fact-based science of phenomenal consciousness is possi-
ble are usually not aware that this assumption requires abandoning the modern scientiﬁc
world view by denying the causal completeness of physics. The problem of experiences
is far more serious than is generally realised.
We face the painful dilemma: either the contemporary scientiﬁc world concept is
correct and there can be no empirically based theories of phenomenal consciousness, or
there can be such theories but then the basic nature of the world is utterly misdescribed
by modern science. The decision to forsake the well established and intelligible world
view would be so radical that we cannot aﬀord to be thoughtless here. It is wise to
discard the materialist world picture only if there are very serious reasons to do so. Are
there, then, any plausible alternatives to the physically determined world?
Experiences can be causally eﬃcacious in two very diﬀerent ways. One possibility is
that phenomenal experiences are like some kind of ﬁeld which is in mutual interaction
with the physical world so that together they form a combined physical-mental reality
with dynamics that obey a deﬁnite set of natural laws (Libet, 1994; Smythies, 1994).
Such a composite physical-mental world
is of the same basic kind as the purely material one in the sense that it is entirely law-
governed. The other, much more extravagant, possibility for phenomenal experiences
to be causally eﬀective is for them to serve as a basis for free-will activity.
The ﬁrst option — that the world is a law-governed composite physical-mental sys-
tem — is logically unproblematic, but we do not have any factual evidence in support
of it. Amazingly, there is suﬃcient ground for preferring the second option — the view
that we and other conscious creatures are free agents — to materialism, even though the
concept of free volition is supernatural, hard to comprehend, and logically problematic.
I shall show in this paper that for simple logical reasons we are justiﬁed in trying always
to follow the thesis of being free agents.
Freedom of will and consciousness studies
The term ‘freedom of will’ is used to denominate two quite diﬀerent properties.
Traditionally — and this is still the commonsense custom — the property of the
will called its freedom has been interpreted as the ability to select one actuality from
several possibilities, as the ability, for anything one tries to do, always to have tried
to do otherwise. Free will in this strong, libertarian sense is incompatible with causal
determinism, for the latter rules out the possibility of a person’s trying to do other than
4

what he does try.
The other, modern tendency is to designate by ‘freedom of will’ the creature’s prop-
erty to function autonomously, to be free of outside coercion and constraint. The
freedom thus deﬁned is compatible with the complete causal necessitation of behaviour.
A decision is free in this compatibilist sense simply because it is one’s own decision, no
matter how rigidly determined by one’s own internal state.
To avoid terminological equivocation, I shall refer to the property free in the liber-
tarian sense by the term ‘Free-Will’, and to the property free in the compatibilist sense
by the term ‘Self-Willed’.
We are, undoubtedly, quite autonomous Self-Willed beings. But are we Free agents,
and which consequences our admittance of having Free Will would have for our conduct
and undertakings? In particular, how is the Free Will problem related to consciousness
studies?
We, people of modern scientiﬁc education, predominantly regard ourselves as mate-
rial creatures lacking supernatural Free Volition. What would be diﬀerent if we accepted
the belief of being Free agents? Our everyday behaviour would probably not change at
all: maybe we would only feel a bit more responsible for our deeds. However, our philo-
sophical apprehension of the general character of the world and our own basic nature
would certainly undergo a radical change. The belief in Free Will would also have a
strong impact upon one essential ﬁeld of our scientiﬁc endeavours — upon consciousness
studies in general and investigations of conscious activities in particular.
If we hold of being Free agents, we have to discard the materialist notion of ourselves,
so that there would be no ideological pressure any more to construe at whatever cost
the phenomenal experiences as speciﬁc physical brain processes explaining away the
existence of phenomenal qualia, and we can then analyse the enigmatic qualitative
character of the content of consciousness with due scientiﬁc impartiality.
If we hold that we are Free agents, we must substantially revise also the method-
ological basis of the current research into the brain–consciousness relationship. This
research (see Crick, 1994) is aimed at ﬁnding out where the neurones responsible for
conscious awareness are located in the brain, and in what way they are ﬁring. It is
taken for granted (Crick and Koch, 1995) that the causal chain stimulus-evoked brain
processes—phenomenal experiences—behavioural reaction to phenomenal experiences is
realised physiologically, by neural networks. It is argued that if a group of neurones
does not project to the brain’s motor areas responsible for our reporting on what we
experience then the activities of these neurones do not contribute to conscious experi-
ences directly. But if we accept the view that the impact of phenomenal experiences
upon the creature’s overt behaviour is mediated by his Free Will, we must admit that a
distinctive feature of consciousness-evoking brain processes is that normally they do not
5

cause our behaviour via neural (purely physical) mechanisms. This implication sharply
contradicts the basic assumptions of current, materialistically motivated consciousness
and brain research programs.
If we hold of being Free agents, we have to acknowledge that the most fundamen-
tally important of all presently conceivable scientiﬁc inquiries is elucidating which brain
events the Free-Will eﬀorts evoke: how the Will modiﬁes the activity of neuronal net-
works in deﬁance of natural causes.
Hence, the Free Will problem is of utmost scientiﬁc import and is most intimately
related to questions about the ontological status and causal eﬃcacy of phenomenal
consciousness. I think this truth should be always stressed when discussing the Free Will
issue, for there is a widespread sentiment to view the Free Will controversy as an esoteric
metaphysical puzzle of academic interest for only a small group of philosophers. That is
why I decided to add to the exposition of the title thesis this lengthy introduction, and
preferred to submit the present article to the Journal of Consciousness Studies rather
than to some ‘purely’ philosophical journal.
The Problem of Free Will
In the Middle Ages European intellectual life was subordinated to religious ideology
which concentrated upon the Free-Will aspects of existence and denied the importance
of studying lawful regularities present in the world. With the rise of modern science when
more and more laws holding in nature were discovered, and partly as an overreaction
to religious dogmatism, the ‘scientiﬁc’ dogma of nomism — the view that the dynamics
of the world are thoroughly law-governed — began to gain popularity. Already many
scholars of the early modern scientiﬁc era, among them Spinoza, Hobbes, Leibniz and
Kant, accepted this view, and in recent times the doctrine of the universal ruling of
natural causality has won support by overwhelming majority of scientists. This has led
to the denial of the Freedom of Will. Let us mention, for example, Albert Einstein’s
ﬁrm antilibertarian convictions. In modern times only very few scientists have dared to
defend the explicitly libertarian views. True, among those few have been such world-
famous scholars as Sir Arthur Eddington, Sir Charles Sherrington and Sir John Eccles.
Some scientists, ﬁnding it implausible to deny our being Free agents responsible for
our conduct, but believing at the same time that the dynamics of the physical world are
entirely regular, have suggested that even a truly Free-Will activity may be compatible
with the universality of lawful dynamics.
One of the ideas aimed at justifying this suggestion has been proposed by Erwin
Schr¨ odinger (1977). He sought to avoid a contradiction between the (allegedly) uni-
versal obtaining of the laws of nature and incontrovertible direct experience that one
6

oneself commands one’s motions, feeling full responsibility for them, by assuming that
every conscious mind controls the motion of the atoms according to the laws of nature.
However, if this thesis were true, then whatever claims that we are aware of nonphysical
aspects of our existence — including the claim that we, following our Free decision, di-
rect the motion of the atoms according to the laws of nature — would be of no evidential
import, because everything that we as material beings would in this case do would have
been done by us in exactly the same way also if we were purely physical deterministically
functioning creatures lacking phenomenal consciousness and Free Will. Our producing
assertions that we are introspectively aware of possessing Free Will could be explained
then as a result of lawful functioning of our material bodies regardless of whether this
lawful functioning is deterministic or Freely evoked.
The other idea about how Free Will can be compatible with universally lawful dy-
namics is more sophisticated. It is argued (see, e.g., Hodgson, 1991, 1994, 1996) that
the Will can exercise its Freedom by selecting between alternatives which quantum in-
determinacy leaves open, preserving at the same time the physically lawful statistics
of sets of quantum events, so that, when described from a physical perspective alone,
Free Will looks like chance. However, in this case a Free agent cannot command its
behaviour Freely according to its best discretion, but must merely play a role of a gen-
erator of random events. The issuing of claims that one knows of having Free Will
would then be explainable as resulting from a combination of one’s lawful and blindly
random functioning, irrespective of whether such functioning is caused by the physical
determinism and randomness, or by one’s Free Volition. If the Will directed quantum
chance in its own aims, the lawful statistics of quantum events would be violated —
if not the low-order, then certainly the higher-order probability distribution functions:
the correlations of outcomes of individual quantum events with the brain’s global state
as it is represented in the content of consciousness evoked by the brain.
The Free-Will behaviour I have in view when formulating a libertarian imperative is
the truly Free-Will behaviour which is not compatible with any kind of physically lawful
functioning of our bodies (brains). Our having of such Free Will is resolutely denied by
modern science.
The Formulation of the Libertarian Imperative
Two aspects of the Free Will problem are discussed intensively by philosophers: the
conceptual aspect — what Free Will means and whether it is compatible with deter-
minism — and the epistemic aspect — how we can get to know the truth about the
presence of Free Will in the world. But a third important aspect of this problem is
almost entirely neglected: the praxeological aspect — according to which belief about
7

possessing Free Will one should behave. I will give an answer to this practical question
by formulating and substantiating a principle of behaviour which I call the Libertarian
Imperative. The Imperative is a normative requirement that is reasonable or unreason-
able relative to general aims of behaviour. In formulating the Libertarian Imperative I
assume that the supreme principle of the person’s conduct is absolute honesty so that
any intentional lying, even by noble motives, is excluded.
By deﬁnition, the Libertarian Imperative is the requirement:
One must always try to act in accord with the
thesis that one has the libertarian Free Will.
I am not entirely content with the given wording of the Imperative. Although I assure
that by Freedom of Will I mean theincompatibilist variety of freedom, I am nevertheless
afraid of claims that any kind of Free Will may be compatible with universal determinism
and that therefore the Imperative need not work against the doctrine of nomism. I will
therefore rephrase the Libertarian Imperative so that it would be ﬁrmly safeguarded
against such misconstruings.
In principle, the Free-Will activity may be strictly regular, but it is natural to think
that a Free agent will hardly give up the possibility to act Freely rather than, without
exception, according to certain rigorous universal rules. Hence, we can regard the Free-
Will activity as a non-nomic activity, i.e. an activity that is not universally lawful, and
reformulate the Libertarian Imperative as follows:
One must always try to act in accord with the
thesis that one is not a law-governed creature.
The Imperative expressed in this form is narrower by its content than it is in its original
formulation for it does not cover the case of universally regular Free-Will activity, and
is, in the ﬁrst place, not a requirement to defend the Free Will thesis, but a call for
attacking the nomist assumption — the view that all processes in the world, including
brain events, obey at some basic level certain rigorous deterministic or probabilistic laws
of dynamics. It would be even better to call the Libertarian Imperative so formulated
an Anti-Nomic Imperative. It is just this Anti-Nomic Imperative that I have in view
when I speak about the Libertarian Imperative below.
The Justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative
In order to understand the explanation why the Libertarian Imperative must be observed
one has to master only two simple concepts: one of the basic concepts used by science
— the meaning of ‘lawful dynamics’ — and one of the basic commonsense concepts —
the meaning of ‘to try’ in everyday practical sense.

The concept of lawful dynamics
What is lawful dynamics is easy to understand in general, but the variety of it that has
most to do with the determinism–libertarianism issue — the deterministic choice-making
between alternatives — is occasioning much confusion. It is argued that determinism
does not preclude the making of choices, but it is often not realised that the deterministic
choice is fundamentally diﬀerent from the Free-Will choice. The Free-Will choice is free
in the sense that one could have selected a distinct alternative from that which one
actually selected. Quite otherwise, the deterministic ‘choice’ is not a choice between
genuine alternatives. But many philosophers are muddling the issue by trying to produce
an impression as if there were no essential diﬀerence between deterministic and Free-Will
choice.
Various tactics are used for selling deterministic choice for a genuine one. Some
argue that deterministic decision-making is not blind obeying of the rules, because the
latter evolve in the course of the system’s functioning. Others claim (see Ho, 1996)
that organisms free themselves from the laws of physics by being coherent wholes whose
parts participate in the coordinated action. But however ‘dynamic’ or ‘holistic’ a de-
terministic process may be, at the basic level it is always determined by blind following
of fundamental rules — the laws of nature.
A vigorous eﬀort to argue for compatibilism is made by Dennett (1984). His tactics
are ingenious. Not believing in libertarian free will, he ﬁnds it reasonable to redeﬁne the
meanings of words and expressions traditionally used for discussing the free will problem
— unavoidable, inevitable, possibility, necessity, open future, can, could have done
otherwise, deliberation, free choice, free will, etc. — by assigning them ‘useful’ content
applicable only in the realm of lawful dynamics. Then a talk about our allegedly nomic
functioning sounds as a good old talk about Free-Will behaviour and is likely to provoke
no protest by unsophisticated common sense. And more importantly, further arguing
about Free Will is rendered impossible because you now lack any words for relevant
concepts — your tongue is amputated. However, Dennett’s exertions to please common
sense while staying faithful to physicalism end, at a closer look, in ﬁasco. Admitting
that we rightly dread such conﬁning circumstances where our options are reduced to
one, he oﬀers us two varieties of open future: the epistemic one (being nescient of what
will happen) and the probabilistic one (being dynamically partly stochastic). To be free
is to be ignorant or at the mercy of blind chance — that is how we can have free will
and science too, in Dennett’s opinion.
If one’s behaviour is deterministic, then at every moment one has only one option
of acting, for this is what determinism means. The outcome of one’s deterministic
deliberation is ﬁxed both in its process and its ultimate product, and thus one cannot
9

prevent its occurrence. This truth is particularly clearly explained by Peter van Inwagen
(1983).
If one’s behaviour is partly probabilistic, then one produces also purely random acts.
In principle, one can, without violating the probabilistic law of dynamics, behave in very
many diﬀerent ways, provided, however, that the actual behavioural pattern produced
would have a blind-chance character satisfying this law.
Consequently, if one’s decision-making and other behavioural acts are law-governed,
one cannot prevent their regular or purely random occurrence.
The commonsense meaning of trying
To understand what ‘to try’ means in an everyday pretheoretic sense is to understand
what one must do to obey such orders as: Try to raise your hand; Try to utter ‘Physi-
calism is fallacious’; Try to imagine a circle; etc. This presupposes possessing practical
abilities to evoke various volitional eﬀorts. This does not presuppose having any knowl-
edge about the brain processes (or soul processes if such exist) involved in voluntary
acts of trying.
The peculiarity of justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative
The scheme of argumentation I will apply in justifying the Libertarian Imperative
doesn’t belong amongst standard methods of scientiﬁc ratiocination. Therefore many
scholars may overlook the argument altogether, and others may wonder why the prag-
matic and narrowly logical mode of reasoning is used instead of approaching the problem
from a natural science perspective. It is necessary to explain in what sense the scheme
of reasoning applied is peculiar. Due to its distinctive character this mode of arguing
enables one to arrive at conclusions not attainable by traditional scientiﬁc methods.
The natural scientiﬁc approach to the world is, in principle, quite simple. By means
of observations a set of empirical data is obtained about the structure of some segment
of reality. The task is to describe this structure in a perspicuous way and to discover
all kinds of regularities and irregularities present either in this structure itself, or in
the structure of that part of reality which is supposedly the cause of, or underlies,
the empirically established structure. The natural scientiﬁc treatment of the Free Will
problem would consist in investigating the spatiotemporal structure of brain processes,
and in elucidating whether it obeys the laws of physical dynamics at atomic level.
A characteristic feature of the natural scientiﬁc method is its applicability from the
third-person point of view. If I want my own brain processes studied, it is scientiﬁcally
preferable to let that be done by other persons — by a team of skilled neuroscientists
— than by myself.

It may seem that any scientiﬁc justiﬁcation of the conformity of our behaviour with
the thesis of our having Free Will must be based on results of natural scientiﬁc research
into brain dynamics. Such opinion is rooted in a plausible-looking assumption that it
is sensible to try to act in accord with the thesis A only if we have ﬁrst established, or
have at least some ground to suppose, that A is true. It seems unbelievable that there
can be a class of situations when it is unconditionally reasonable to act on the basis of
the thesis A, while having no reason for holding that A rather than not-A is true. But
there are such situations. Here is a simple example.
Suppose an expedition has been sent to an alien planet with a task to explore its
ionosphere. By accident, all measuring equipment gets crushed in landing. However,
in spite of having learned absolutely nothing about the physical characteristics of the
planet’s ionosphere, the research team is, nevertheless, justiﬁed in trying to forward to
the Earth the reports of the following type about these characteristics: ‘The planet’s
ionosphere transmits radio waves of the frequency used in sending this message’. The
issuing of such messages is justiﬁed because they don’t reach the addressee if false.
The attempts to send such messages can make things in the world only better (if the
messages are true) in the sense of how much true knowledge its inhabitants possess, but
not worse (if the messages are false).
The reason why in speciﬁc cases it is unquestionably sound to perform certain acts in
accordance with a premise of which we don’t know if it is right or wrong, is purely logical:
if the actual states of aﬀairs are in these cases such that our premise is wrong, these same
states of aﬀairs prevent our acts from being eﬃcacious. In such a case a proposition can
be accepted as a basis for sensible behaviour solely because of the situation’s speciﬁc
logical structure regardless of any knowledge as to whether this proposition is true or
false. This logical structure is rendered peculiar by a self-referentiality present in it.
That kind of justiﬁcation of behaviour is narrowly logical rather than natural scien-
tiﬁc, but as far as it is based on sound logic, and logic is deemed a scientiﬁc discipline,
it is deﬁnitely a speciﬁc variety of scientiﬁc justiﬁcation. The ideal limit of the cases
where such kind of substantiation of behaviour is possible is the unique situation of
being faced with the problem of one’s own Freedom of the Will. In this case the pecu-
liarity of the logical structure of the situation — the presence of self-referentiality in it
— is warranted by the fact that one has to reason about the character of this reasoning
itself. The relevant reasoning can be performed only from the ﬁrst-person point of view
— it can be used for justifying only one’s own behaviour — and so it contrasts sharply
with standard scientiﬁc argumenting which can always be applied from the third-person
perspective.

Why the Libertarian Imperative should be obeyed
The reason why we should always try to act as if we know that we are Free agents even
if we actually don’t know this, is rather simple. I think most people are aware of that
reason subconsciously. Such awareness is implicitly evident in claims like: ‘Any discus-
sion is meaningless if there are no freely willing agents’, ‘Be kind to the determinists for
they have had no choice about what they think and write’, etc. I shall explicate this
reason as clearly as I can.
Any of our volitional eﬀorts is either a nomic process obeying at some fundamental
level deﬁnite deterministic or probabilistic laws of dynamics, or it is a non-nomic, Free
act exempt at any fundamental level of description from the laws of nature.
If our volitional activity is, and has always been, nomic, then: (i) if we maintain
that our activity is nomic, we are right; and (ii) if we maintain that our activity is not
nomic, we are wrong, but we are wrong unavoidably, because we cannot then prevent the
regular or purely random law-governed occurrence of our mental and behavioural acts.
If the laws of dynamics are strictly deterministic, any other course of our behaviour
could not, out of nomic necessity, have taken place. And if the laws of dynamics are, at
least partly, fundamentally probabilistic, various courses of our behaviour might have
realised, but then only by pure chance over which nothing and nobody can have control
in order to avoid any particular way of behaviour.
If our volitional activity is not nomic, then: (i) if we maintain that our activity is not
nomic, we are right; and (ii) if we maintain that our activity is nomic, we are wrong, yet
we are wrong not unavoidably , because as Free agents we could have behaved otherwise,
i.e. could have maintained that our volitional activity is not nomic.
Consequently, in order to behave in the most reasonable way possible (provided we
seek the truth) in respect to the Free Will problem, we must attempt to act always in
conformity with the thesis that our functioning is not law-governed, for if our activity
is, in fact, not nomic, our such attempts cohere with the truth, and if we actually are
law-governed beings, whatever attempts by us are not the kind of acts that can make
things in the world either better or worse than they would otherwise be, because then
these attempts themselves belong to nature’s causal network and their lawful occurrence,
either deterministic or random, cannot be avoided. It is reasonable to try to behave as
a libertarian by maintaining that our functioning is at no level of description strictly
lawful.
The Speciﬁc Features of the Libertarian Imperative
The justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative is easily understandable because what
is justiﬁed in the ﬁrst place is not one’s attempt to claim that one’s behaviour is Free-
12

Volitional, but one’s trying to deny that one’s behaviour is lawful (unavoidable), and the
concept of lawful dynamics is much more easily comprehensible than that of Free-Will
activity. The simplicity of justiﬁcation of the Imperative may even create an impression
that it is a cheap sophistry.
The Libertarian Imperative is not an epistemic statement: it doesn’t assert that one
knows that his activity is not law-governed. However, for the reason that the Imperative
requires one to try to behave on the basis of the thesis that he possesses Free Will,
obeying the Imperative is — by its consequences to one’s activity — equivalent to the
acceptance by him of the belief that he knows he has Free Will.
The Libertarian Imperative is ontologically general in the sense that it requires the
attempting to deny not only the physical (materialistic) universal determinateness of
one’s behaviour, but also any other kind of such determinateness, be it purely spiritual,
or forced by some kind of divine power, or whatever.
From the logical form of the justiﬁcation scheme of the Libertarian Imperative it is
evident that it can be applied extremely restrictedly — only for justifying those of one’s
own occurrent volitional eﬀorts which are aimed at presenting or investigating these
same eﬀorts as the exemplars of non-nomic events. The logical basis of the Imperative
does not justify my trying to regard my other volitional acts, let alone the behaviour
of other individuals, as non-nomic. Any suggestions about the wider domain of the
Free-Will behaviour can only be scientiﬁc-hypothetically motivated.
The Libertarian Imperative,
William James’ Will to Believe, and Pascal’s Wager
My justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative may seem to have much in common with
William James’ stance toward free will as presented in his essay ‘The Will to Believe’
(James, 1979, pp. 13–33). In fact, there is not much similarity between my and James’
positions.
Strictly speaking, my position is identical to that of James’ only in the following
sense: we both hold that there are propositions which cannot be ignored for the reason
that we don’t have any grounds whatsoever for judging whether they are true or false.
James argues for the right of turning certain speciﬁc propositions of this kind into beliefs.
I claim that it is reasonable to try to act as if some of these propositions were true.
There is a diﬀerence between (i) accepting a proposition as a belief and (ii) acting as if
the proposition were true without believing it to be true. I admit that this diﬀerence is
a rather subtle one, therefore I will not object much if one says that I argue like James
for justiﬁability of accepting belief in certain propositions the truth value of which is
not known. But with this the similarities between James’ and my positions end.

There are two substantial diﬀerences between James’ and my arguments.
(1) James claims that our passional nature is a lawful determinant of our choice if
there is a genuine option that cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds;
that we have the right to believe at our own risk any hypothesis that is live enough
to tempt our will. I, on the contrary, do not appeal to our ‘non-intellectual nature’
but to our ‘purely judging mind’, to our ‘dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet
hypothesis’. True, as James has emphasized, one has to admit the ﬁrst steps necessarily
on emotional grounds: ‘Science herself consults her heart when she lays it down that
the inﬁnite ascertainment of fact and correction of false belief are the supreme goods for
man’. However, from this onwards I take ‘no farther passional step’ but rely exclusively
upon our merely logical intellect, upon our pure rationality, by presenting a sensible
proof, a coercive demonstrative argument. I show that the problem I address is intellec-
tually decidable, without any need to let our passional nature decide the answer. The
James’ sort of argument justiﬁes belief in Free Will onpragmatic/psychological grounds,
while my defence of the Libertarian Imperative is purely logical.
(2) The realm of problems to which James’ approach is applicable is rather wide,
whereas my way of argumentation can be applied extremely restrictedly: for justifying
only very speciﬁc beliefs (roughly speaking). For justifying the other beliefs which are
justiﬁable in James’ sense, my method does not work at all. This is because my way of
reasoning derives its logical power from the fact that it selects as the propositionA in the
task ‘Please justify a voluntary acceptance of belief in proposition A’ the precondition
of this task itself: ‘you have a power of voluntary decision-making’.
Since my way of argumentation addresses a judging mind, it is also apt to compare
it with Pascal’s Wager type of reasoning which likewise appeals to intellect.
Pascal advised us to believe in God, for if we did and God indeed exists, we would
gain eternal beatitude, while we risk only a ﬁnite loss if God does not exist, and a
possible ﬁnite loss is reasonable, if there is but the probability of inﬁnite gain.
The arguments of Pascal’s Wager type are entirely sensible. Particularly, Pascal’s
Wager type argument in defence of Free Will is quite powerful. Free Will is so important
phenomenon that, even if one has not yet any convincing evidence for its existence, it is
unreasonable to ignore the possibility that Free Will may, after all, exist in the world,
and to declare the Free Will issue solved and closed.
My defence of the Libertarian Imperative is not, however, of Pascal’s Wager type.
My logic of reasoning may seem to be closely related to the logic of Pascal’s Wager
because I stress a truism that the Free Will issue is not an unimportant minor problem
that doesn’t deserve serious attention. But here the resemblance ends.
There are two essential diﬀerences between my argumentation and Pascal’s Wager
type of reasoning.
14

## Page 15

```text
(1) Pascal’s Wager type of reasoning consists in weighing gains and losses of alter-
native decisions, and its conclusions depend on how large or small are those gains and
losses, and how reliable is our assessment of them. Such reasoning is of game-theoretical
type. My argumentation is not of game-theoretical type. Its conclusion doesn’t depend
at all on how large or small are gains and losses of alternative decisions, or whether
there are any gains and losses at all.
(2) Pascal’s Wager type of reasoning can be applied to making decisions about a
very wide class of alternatives: we use this kind of reasoning quite often in our everyday
life. My scheme of argumentation can be applied extremely restrictedly: only in the
case of one very particular kind of problems. The problem about one’s own Free Will
is one of them due to its unique logical structure. One is not asked to choose whether
he believes or not that God exists, or that people have immaterial souls, or that there
is afterlife, etc., but one is asked to choose whether he believes or not that he is able to
choose. Just owing to this self-referentiality present in the task it is possible to solve it
by purely logical means.
Complementarity of Logical and Natural Scientiﬁc
Approaches to the Free Will Problem
The narrowly logical approach to the Free Will problem cannot replace the natural
scientiﬁc research into the general character of living beings’ functioning. The logical
reasoning, unlike empirical investigations, cannot give us any knowledge about whether
our functioning, or that of other creatures, is lawful. This truth is very easy to under-
stand.
It is not so easy to see, however, that natural scientiﬁc studies of our activity cannot,
in turn, replace the narrowly logical approach to it.
Let us consider ﬁrst the case when our activity is non-nomic at any level of de-
scription. Can we ascertain this fact by means of empirical inquiries? Obviously not.
Suppose it has been established that at the most basic level accessible to investigations
at a given time our functioning is not entirely nomic. This gives us, however, no guar-
antee that at some deeper level of description our dynamics may not be fully lawful.
By way of natural scientiﬁc explorations it is in principle impossible to ﬁnd out that
our activity is not law-governed. If we remain satisﬁed with natural scientiﬁc reasoning
only, we will never have a ﬁrm justiﬁcation for behaving in accordance with the view
that our activity is not nomic. The logical approach to the problem does give us such
a basis.
But how would matters stand if empirical research showed our functioning to be
fully lawful? It may seem that in this case the logical reasoning applied in justifying
15
```

## Page 16

```text
the Libertarian Imperative recommends to act contrary to what scientiﬁc knowledge
implies, and is, therefore, not complementary to natural scientiﬁc reasoning but plainly
defective. However, this is not the case. Let me remind you that the logical argument
doesn’t justify regarding acts already accomplished by oneself as non-nomic; it justiﬁes
only one’s trying to maintain that this same trying, and its results if it succeeded, are
not nomically determined. Since the act of trying, that one is going to evoke is not
an accomplished event about which there can be scientiﬁc knowledge, the acceptance
of conclusions of the logical argument can bring one into conﬂict not with empirically
established facts, but at worst only with a hypothetical suggestion that one’s activity
which has been law-governed in the past would remain law-governed also in the future.
The thesis ‘It is always reasonable to try to behave as a libertarian’ should not
be interpreted as follows: Of all logically possible states in which a person of a given
kind might be, it is epistemically more advantageous for him to be in a state of trying
to behave, or behaving, according to the belief of having Free Will. It is undoubtedly
epistemically disadvantageous to be a libertarian when one’s functioning is deterministic
in fact. The libertarian thesis should be understood as follows: Given that one is the
way one actually is , if one behaves or will try to behave as a libertarian, one’s such
activity is epistemically the most advantageous of all actually possible — that is: both
logically and nomically possible — ways of behaviour even when one’s functioning is
in fact deterministic, because in the latter case there simply are no actually possible
alternatives to one’s factual behaviour.
The praxeological approach, complementary to the natural scientiﬁc one, to the
problem of one’s own Freedom of Will is possible for the reason that we can exercise our
Freedom of Choice, if we have it, even while ignorant of whether we have it. Such an
approach — trying to obey the Libertarian Imperative — is, in essence, an experimental
settling of the Free Will controversy. The Imperative can be viewed as the following
call: let us not speculate whether Free Will is theoretically possible; let us also not ask
whether we have any empirical evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free
Will; let us take, instead, a straightforwardly experimental approach to this problem
— let us try to behave as is appropriate to Free agents and see if we succeed in it.
Such experimenting is subject to a reliable protection mechanism: if it is foredoomed
to failure, it spoils nothing because it can’t be then executed at all. If our behaviour is
law-governed, we cannot experiment with it because we cannot then act otherwise than
we are forced to act according to these laws.
On the Metaphysical Possibility of Free Will
Although the possibility of Free Will is not a precondition for justifying the Liber-
16
```

## Page 17

```text
tarian Imperative (as I explained above, obeying the Imperative is reasonable even
in the strictly deterministic world), it is, nevertheless, appropriate to wonder whether
Freedom of Will is at all conceivable. This question is a pressing one because of the
plausible-looking logical (metaphysical) argument against the possibility of Free Will.
It is contended that Freedom is not possible in any kind of possible world because our
actions which are not necessitated by prior states of the world have no cause and are
thus fortuitous, and a fortuitous event is no kind of Free choice. The libertarian view
that a choice is Free only if it is not causally determined by preceding events is regarded
as obscure and obscurantic, if not incoherent.
I shall combat the metaphysical argument against Free Will from two angles. First,
I stress that the impossibility of devising an easily understandable deﬁnition or expla-
nation of what Free Will is is not decisive evidence that the concept of Free Will is
incoherent. There are universally accepted concepts that are, likewise, not explicable
in a simple way. Secondly, I show that the concept of natural causation, even if applied
to the most simple cases of the physically deterministic causation processes, is rather
controversial, and that a relevant analysis reveals that the concept of natural causation
is closely reminiscent of the concept of agent-causation used to explain the meaning of
Free-Will activity.
Irreducibility of the concept of Free Will
Some aspects of reality and concepts of these aspects are simple and easy to under-
stand. Identity, diﬀerence, natural numbers, linear sequence, ﬂat space, regular order,
randomness, and the like are relatively simple, low-grade concepts. However, there
are also higher-grade concepts such as inﬁnity, time, consciousness, Free-Will activity,
omnipotence. It is impossible to downgrade the high-grade concepts to the level of
low-grade ones. This impossibility must not be regarded as a mark of incoherence of
high-grade concepts. I shall give an example.
It is easy to understand what ‘to be actually the case’ means. The concept of actual
existence is easily comprehended. But if we try to explain what time is, we have to use,
in addition, the concept of past existence. Now, everything that belongs to the past
does not exist actually, in the same sense as what belongs to the present does. Neither
is the past a mere fabrication of fantasy. Some philosophers insist that there can be no
third possibility between actual existence and nonexistence, and therefore time cannot
have the property commonly regarded as intrinsic to it: that only the present exists
actually, while the past does not exist any more and the future does not exist yet. They
argue that time is like space, all its moments/points — those of past, present and future
— existing actually, ‘at once’, in exactly the same way. However, there is no reason to
17
```

## Page 18

```text
think that from the irreducibility of high-grade concepts of past and future existence to
the level of lower-grade concepts of actual existence and nonexistence it follows that the
traditional intuitively well-comprehensible concept of time is incoherent and therefore
only the continua of spatial type can exist.
Likewise, there is no reason to think that from the irreducibility of the high-grade
concept of Free-Will behaviour to the level of lower-grade concepts of lawful and stochas-
tic dynamics it follows that the intuitively well-comprehensible commonsense concept
of Free Will is incoherent. It is illegitimate to maintain that all basic aspects of reality
must be categorially trivial. Longing for a categorially simple world must not blind us
to the extent that we deny our most subtle intellectual capacities — our abilities to
comprehend the content of high-grade concepts.
The nontrivial character of the concept of natural causation
Those who argue that the concept of Free-Will behaviour is incoherent because the only
intelligible varieties of behaviour are allegedly the deterministic and random ones, think
that the concept of causally deterministic dynamics is simple. They have hardly ever
been interested in what causality really means and how it is metaphysically possible.
The objective, natural sciences explore only the spatiotemporal formal structure of
the world: its abstract form and not its content (see Russell, 1927, p. 163; Carnap, 1969,
pp. 19, 28, 107). The task of sciences is to discover the laws of nature — the universal
structural regularities present in the world — whereas the problem of whether these
laws are sustained, e.g., by the divine will or by the essence of the material substance,
is not the business of science but of metaphysics. Given that the laws of nature as
they are do hold ﬁrmly, the knowledge of how they are sustained has no pragmatic
signiﬁcance whatsoever. To extinguish the metaphysical curiosity, it is suggested to rely
upon the principle of parsimony by looking ﬁrst for the simplest reasons, and to accept
therefore the belief that the world’s order, including the causal one, is guaranteed by
the material substance itself. As the fundamental laws of physics are relatively simple,
people consider this belief to be reasonable, yet they never wonder seriously how the
causal process might work. Let us ask this question then.
The causal sequence of the simplest type can be conceived as follows. There is some
state of aﬀairs S1 at the moment t1. Because of causality, S1 gives rise to the state S2 an
instant later, at the moment t2. How can this happen? Will S1 cease to exist at t1 and S2
arise from nothing at t2, so that cause and eﬀect would be temporally separated? Hardly
so. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that the causal process is continuous: the state S1
changes into the state S2. Admitting that the change is something more than the mere
possession of a sequence of diﬀerent properties at diﬀerent times, i.e. that the pace of
18
```

## Page 19

```text
change of a state is itself a deﬁnite characteristic of that state, we reach the following
conclusion. While the transformation of the state from S1 to S2 is determined purely
logically by the state’s pace of change, the causality in its substantial sense concerning
the physical causal ‘activity’ of the material substance itself is eﬀective in determining
one aspect of the state — its pace of change — by other aspects of that state at the
very same moment . All fundamental equations of physical dynamics express just this
dependence, both sides of the equations referring to the physical situation at one and
the same moment. The substantial causal process consists not in the determination of
the present by the past, but in the self-determination of the present independently of
preceding conditions. Sounds like the ‘obscure and panicky’ metaphysics of libertari-
anism? If one contends that the libertarian notion of an originative agent capable of
contributing something independently of antecedent causes and conditions is obscure to
a discomforting degree, if not positively mysterious, one has to concede that then the
ordinary concept of causation should also be regarded as ‘obscure’. It is useful to bear
in mind that the most traditional concept of causation is not trivial, and is reminis-
cent of the libertarian concept of agent-causation according to which the Free agents
self-determine their own character partly independently of their antecedent properties,
being the prime movers or ﬁrst causes of their own actions. The libertarian Free activity
is not so disparate from the natural causal process as it seems to be at the ﬁrst glance.
Causation may well be compatible not only with the deterministic choice but also with
the Free-Will choice.
The Peirastic Rejection of Materialism
There are various empirically grounded arguments which question the validity of ma-
terialism (see, e.g., Lowe, 1996; Uus, 1994). The argumentation used in justifying the
Libertarian Imperative gives us, in addition, a ﬁrm logical basis for challenging materi-
alistic ideology.
The Libertarian Imperative requires us to try to reject any philosophy about our
nature which claims that we are entirely lawfully functioning creatures. This means that
we must also try to regard materialism as fallacious. Such abandoning of materialism,
if we succeed in it, would not be epistemic: the Imperative is not based on knowledge
that our behaviour is not law-governed. Rather, such discarding of materialism may be
called peirastic (from the Greek word peirastikos: involving, or performing, an attempt)
because it is based on our ability, if we have it, to try to act and act in this way, and is
logically justiﬁed for the reason that if this our ability is guaranteed by our Free Volition,
we would be right in dismissing materialism, and if our abandoning of materialism has
taken place in the course of our physically lawful functioning, then we were forced to act
19

just this way in order not to spoil the materialistically lawful character of the world’s
dynamics.
The Libertarian Imperative urges us to discard the materialistic world view together
with its dogmatic impact upon our scientiﬁc research programs. In particular, the
Imperative urges us to try to reject the thesis that brains are just very complicated
physical organs whose dynamics obey the laws of physics, and accept, instead, the
view that the impact of phenomenal experiences upon the creature’s overt behaviour is
mediated by his Free Will.
We have nothing to lose but we may gain immensely if we dare to try to discard
materialism and profess libertarianism.
