Dear Dr. Sutherland, 
 
    Herewith I send you a copy of a manuscript of my article “The 
Libertarian Imperative and its implications for consciousness 
studies.” I intend to submit this article to the Journal of 
Consciousness Studies in the hope that they will publish it. 
However, I send this copy to you not as the publisher of the JCS, 
but as one of the scholars whom I know of being seriously 
interested in the free will issue (I regularly watch jcs-online 
and psyche-d discussions of consciousness problems), and whose 
opinion about my paper I should like to know before submitting it 
for publishing. I shall send the copies of this manuscript also to  
Daniel Dennett, Peter van Inwagen, David Hodgson, John Beloff, 
Timothy Sprigge and Piet Hut. If you would have any critical comments 
on this paper, would you please let me know of them, no matter in how 
concise a form. (My email address is: uus@obs.ee) 
 
                           With best regards,  
                           Yours 
                           Undo Uus

Dear Sirs, 
 
I have completed an article on the free will problem "The Libertarian 
Imperative and its implications for consciousness studies" and should  
like to submit it for publication in the Journal of Consciousness 
Studies. Could you please tell me to whom of the editors of JCS you 
recommend to send the manuscript of this article? 
 
I should like to send the text of my article to you also in an 
ordinary (ascii) email. Could you plese send me by email an example 
(template) of such a file (e.g. an article already published in JCS; 
I subscribe for JCS) so that I could indicate captions, quotations,  
references, different fonts, etc in the way most advantageous for you.

I'd be quite interested in seeing it myself (address below).

The thing is we need it in a form that's suitable for peer review, 
rather than pre-coded for typesetting.  This is why we encourage rtf or 
encoded submissions of original wordprocessor files, rather than plain  
ascii

 Dear Dr. Sutherland, 
 
   Herewith I send you four copies of a manuscript of my article ″The  
Libertarian Imperative and its implications for consciousness 
studies.'' (Three copies are double-spaced, whereas the page format 
of the fourth copy is in a good approximation homologous to the 
new page format of the JCS so that it is possible to judge about the 
article's length in pages if printed in the JCS.)  
 
   I would be very glad if this my paper will be published in the 
Journal of Consciousness Studies. Could you please tell me when 
(approximately) you suppose you would reach the conclusion about 
whether or not this article is suitable for being printed in JCS. (My 
e-mail address is: uus@obs.ee)  
       
         Yours,   Undo Uus

From: Keith Sutherland <keith@imprint.co.uk> 
Subject: The Libertarian Imperative 
 
Dear Undo Uus 
 
Many thanks for sending me your interesting paper, which I greatly 
enjoyed reading.  I'm personally sympathetic to your argument, but the 
paper would need to go through several iterations before it could be  
released for peer review in a hostile intellectual environment.  I can 
think of a number of pre-reviewers who should be asked to read it, but 
it would need a lot of work done on it first. 
 
The first task would be to read E.J. Lowe's "Subjects of Experience" 
(CUP 1996), which is an excellent critique of materialism, in many ways 
similar to your own.  I will send you my personal copy.  It might also 
help to start with a short review of scientists' attempts to resolve the 
problem -- in particular Schrödinger's debate on free will with 
Einstein and his puzzling on the topic in "What is Life": 
 
        `My body functions as a pure mechanism according to the laws of 
nature. Yet I know, by incontrovertible direct experience, that I am 
directing its motions, of which I foresee the effects, that may be 
fateful and all-important, in which case I feel and take full 
responsibility for them. To avoid a contradiction here, he said, "The 
only possible inference from these two facts is, I think, that I -- I in 
the widest meaning of the word, that is to say, every conscious mind 
that has ever said or felt 'I' -- am the person, if any, who controls 
the 'motion of the atoms' according to the laws of nature." And this 
would lead you to say, Schroedinger provocatively suggested: "Hence I am 
God Almighty".' 
 
I've marked a number of small textual corrections on the manuscript 
which I will return to you.  But the biggest problem is the last few 
pages, beginning with your attack on Crick and Koch.  Why do you single 
them out for mention?  Your paper focuses on volition and free will and 
C&K have chosen to research an area which is arguably furthest removed 
from this.  I think you also do your case a disservice by suggesting 
that many scientists are guilty of a lack of private honesty.  I'm sure 
that this may well be true of some, but it is an unfair generalisation.
```

As regards "ideological bias", this is something that we all suffer from 
in one form or another.  The paper then ends up more as an exercise in 
rhetoric than a careful argument. 
 
Also given the wide criticisms of attempting to equate free will with 
quantum indeterminacy I would be inclined to cut this section back, 
along with anything else that distracts from your central thesis.  After 
all you have no need to prove the existence of free will, so why not let 
others take the flack? 
 
What I'm getting at is that it would be a shame to spoil a well argued 
paper by alienating most of the readers with the final section.  Far 
better to simply state the argument and to let readers draw their own 
conclusions, which are staring them in the face.  I would feel much more 
confident about sending it out for pre-review after these major 
alterations are done.  I had in mind Lowe, Chalmers, Hodgson, Mangan, 
Rosenberg and also a colleague in political philosophy. 
 
As an illustration of the validity of this sort of psychology, when your 
own book came in for review some time ago, our reviews editor took one 
look at the title and then sidelined it into the "rants, tracts and  
diatribes" section.  Far better to present radical critiques in a 
moderate temperate style.
