THE LIBERTARIAN IMPERATIVE
Undo Uus,* Tartu Observatory, EE2444, Estonia. E-mail: uus@obs.ee
Abstract: The prevailing trend of deeming subjective experiences causally idle obfuscates
consciousness research as epiphenomenal entities cannot be studied. The most ﬂexible way
for conscious experiences to be eﬃcacious is for them to serve as a basis for free action.
Regrettably, no objective evidence testiﬁes for this possibility and subjective feelings of having
free will are judged deceptive. In this paper I shall explain that if we uncompromisingly seek
the truth we must for purely logical reasons, irrespective of theoretical ideas and empirical
data about the origin of our activity, follow the Libertarian Imperative — the demand to try
always to act in accord with the belief that one exercises the incompatibilist free volition.
The Libertarian Imperative urges us to try to reject any conception about our nature —
including the modern scientiﬁc picture of human beings — which claims that we are entirely
law-governed creatures.
Our epistemic situation is agonising. On one hand, scientiﬁc observations strongly
suggest that the world is thoroughly physical — a huge system that ultimately
consists of relatively simple fundamental physical entities which obey deterministic
or probabilistic laws of dynamics. On the other hand, we are subjectively aware
of undergoing phenomenal experiences and of being free originative agents. But
phenomenal consciousness and genuine, incompatibilist free volition have no place
in the physicalistic world picture, and, given the immense theoretical and technical
achievements of modern materialistic sciences, there is a tremendous psychological
pressure to deny their existence. It is no wonder that the scholarly community
has almost entirely succumbed to this pressure. Fortunately, the darkest years of
dominance by radical materialism are over and the issue of consciousness has begun
to attract the attention it deserves.
The Tangled Rehabilitation of Consciousness
Although hardly anybody denies the existence of consciousness these days, many
philosophers try to explain it away by redeﬁning it in purely physicalistic formal-
structural terms (see Churchland, 1995; Dennett, 1991; Hardcastle, 1995). However,
there is an insuperable obstacle to these aspirations: the phenomenal qualitative
character or qualia of conscious experiences. The attempts to treat qualia in the
language of orthodox physics are utterly unconvincing and doomed to failure because
qualia — including the most general qualeexperientialness or something-it-is-like-to-
be-ness which is inherent to every phenomenon of consciousness — and the formal-
structural concepts of physics — whether about simple or extremely complicated
systems and processes — belong to entirely diﬀerent categories. For that reason ever
more philosophers admit that the phenomenon which has been traditionally called
consciousness and is now often called phenomenal consciousness does not ﬁt into the

strictly physicalistic world scheme (see, e.g., Searle, 1992; Chalmers, 1995, 1996).
They suppose that phenomenal consciousness is either like some sort of ‘ﬁeld’ — the
ﬁeld of phenomenal experience — which exists over and above the physical ﬁelds and
particles, or it is the intrinsic qualitative essence of physical entities themselves, as
panpsychists have always suggested. Both these positions amount to the abandoning
of the belief that the world is ontologically thoroughly physical in the traditional
sense.
Regrettably, the rehabilitation of consciousness has become tangled as the major-
ity of scholars who acknowledge the existence of phenomenal experiences try to save
the basic doctrines of the materialist world concept. They hold that the nonphysi-
cal constituents and properties of reality don’t give rise to any deviations from the
physically lawful dynamics of the world. By assuming that the physical domain is
causally autonomous, the causal behaviour of the physical world is theoretically safe-
guarded from any ‘marring’ impact from the extraphysical. Moreover, the physical
domain is considered to be not only causally autonomous but also causally suﬃcient:
it is held that the physical determines not only its own dynamics but also the entire
existence of the nonphysical. Though the world is allowed to be ontologically het-
erogeneous, its causal thread is believed to be homogeneous — completely physical.
The thesis of the epiphenomenality of consciousness is explicitly advocated, e.g., by
Frank Jackson (1982), David Lewis (1995) and David Chalmers (1995, 1996).
The concept of epiphenomenal consciousness is not problematic in the case when
consciousness is some kind of ‘ﬁeld of experience’ distinct from physical reality. The
situation is more complicated when the phenomenal experience is the intrinsic con-
tent of the physical reality itself. In this case we are not justiﬁed in claiming that
the phenomenal content lacks any causal eﬃcacy: the content of physical entities
determines their interaction and dynamics. However, given the character of phe-
nomenal qualia as we know them, and the character of the laws of dynamics that
are regarded as physical, we can legitimately claim that the ‘physical’ qualia are
causally idle (Uus, 1994, pp. 115–9). Any impact the qualitative content of physical
entities can have upon the behaviour of some physical system must be entirely ev-
ident in the form of basic equations of dynamics of these entities. That the highly
complex qualia must be causally ineﬃcient when they are the noumenal essence of
the basic components of physical reality is apparent from the fact that on the basis
of the fundamental laws of physics it is impossible to ﬁgure out which kind these
qualia are. Hence, the concept of epiphenomenal consciousness is intelligible also
in the case when the phenomenal experiences are the essence of the physical reality
itself.
The epiphenomenalist theories of consciousness have been criticised by several
authors (see Beloﬀ, 1994; Elitzur, 1995; Hodgson, 1994, 1996; Lowe, 1995; Warner,
1996), most forcefully by Daniel Dennett (1991, pp. 398–406). The fatal defect of
theories of epiphenomena is that they cut themselves oﬀ from any empirical basis.
The fact-based theories of epiphenomena are impossible for logical reasons.
It is logically possible that our subjective experiences are causally inert. There
is also nothing counterlogical in advancing a theory that we actually have certain
epiphenomenal experiences. It can even be agreed that everyone of us knows that
this theory is correct, because everyone of us is necessarily aware of one’s own
experiences (Lowe, 1996, p. 190). But it is illogical to claim that this kind of
2

consciousness can serve as an empirical basis for our theoretical speculations about
it, or that we can make reports of evidential value about the content of such a
consciousness. A defender of epiphenomenal consciousness is justiﬁed to contend,
as Chalmers (1996, p. 198) does:
I know I am conscious, and the knowledge is based solely on my immediate experience. To
say that the knowledge makes no diﬀerence to my psychological functioning is not to say the
experience makes no diﬀerence to me.
But, on pain of self-contradiction, he cannot assure us that he asserts he knows he is
conscious because he knows he is conscious. He has to concede that according to his
own views his statement has been produced by his psychological (neurophysiological)
functioning no matter whether he in fact knows he is conscious.
The belief in the autonomy of the physical world spoils the endeavours to rehabil-
itate phenomenal consciousness. If a champion of phenomenal experiences believes
in the causal suﬃciency of physics, he must hold that the experiences are causally
idle, and in doing so, he exposes himself to ridicule by his physicalist adversaries
and strips the problem of phenomenal consciousness of any scientiﬁc import. If one
argues like Chalmers (1995) that there is the really hard problem of experiences
but that explaining (i) the access to one’s own internal states, (ii) the production
of reports about mental events, and (iii) the deliberate control of behaviour are all
easy problems concerning only the neurophysiological mechanisms and processes,
one falls an easy prey to his physicalist opponents who use an indefeasible logical
argument to force him to admit that (i) the ‘really hard problem’ is, in fact, merely
one of the ‘easy’ problems, since the reason why the intellectual wrestling with the
‘hard problem’ arises and leads to deﬁnite conclusions can be explained ‘easily’ as
being the result of the neurophysiological processes alone, and that therefore (ii)
the concept of epiphenomenal experiences presents only as negligible an interest to
sciences as a hypothesis about the physical ﬁelds which surround material particles
but exert no impact on anything.
A majority of the proponents of phenomenal consciousness hold to the view that
the nonphysical is causally idle, and for that reason most of the modern theories of
phenomenal consciousness are demolished by materialists before they really get oﬀ
the ground. The philosophy of consciousness is in a stalemate.
Can There Be a Science of Phenomenal Consciousness?
From what has been said above it should be clear that any fact-based theory of
phenomenal consciousness is incompatible with the doctrine of the causal closure of
the physical universe as we know it.The empirically grounded science of phenomenal
consciousness is possible only if the physical world as conceptualised by modern
materialistic philosophy is causally open. This proposition must be regarded as the
cornerstone of any logically sound philosophy of phenomenal consciousness.
Those who assume that the fact-based science of phenomenal consciousness is
possible are usually not aware that this assumption requires abandoning the modern
scientiﬁc world view by denying the causal completeness of physics. The problem
of experiences is far more serious than is generally realised.
We face the painful dilemma: either the contemporary scientiﬁc world concept
is correct and there can be no empirically based theories of phenomenal conscious-

ness, or there can be such theories but then the basic nature of the world is utterly
misdescribed by modern science. The decision to forsake the well established and
intelligible world view would be so radical that we cannot aﬀord to be thoughtless
here. It is wise to discard the materialist world picture only if there are very seri-
ous reasons to do so. Are there, then, any plausible alternatives to the physically
determined world?
Experiences can be causally eﬃcacious in two very diﬀerent ways. One possibil-
ity is that phenomenal experiences are like some kind of ﬁeld which is in mutual
interaction with the physical world so that together they form a combined physical-
mental reality with dynamics that obey a deﬁnite set of natural laws (Libet, 1994;
Smythies, 1994). Such a composite physical-mental world is of the same basic kind
as the purely material one in the sense that it is entirely law-governed. The other,
much more extravagant, possibility for phenomenal experiences to be causally eﬀec-
tive is for them to serve as a basis for free-will activity.
The ﬁrst option — that the world is a law-governed composite physical-mental
system — is logically unproblematic, but we do not have any factual evidence in
support of it. Amazingly, there is suﬃcient ground for preferring the second option
— the view that we and other conscious creatures are free agents — to materialism,
even though the concept of free volition is supernatural, hard to comprehend, and
logically problematic. I shall show in this paper that for simple logical reasons we
are justiﬁed in trying always to follow the thesis of being free agents, and hold that
a fact-based science of phenomenal consciousness is possible.
The Problem of Free Will
The term ‘freedom of will’ is used to denominate two quite diﬀerent properties.
Traditionally — and this is still the commonsense custom — the property of the
will called its freedom has been interpreted as the ability to select one actuality
from several possibilities, as the ability, for anything one tries to do, always to have
tried to do otherwise. Free will in this strong sense is incompatible with causal
determinism, for the latter rules out the possibility of a person’s trying to do other
than what he does try. Such incompatibilist, libertarian free volition transcends
natural causality.
The other, modern tendency is to designate by ‘freedom of will’ the creature’s
property to function autonomously, to be free of outside coercion and constraint.
The freedom thus deﬁned is compatible with the complete causal necessitation of
behaviour. A decision is free in this compatibilist sense simply because it is one’s
own decision, no matter how rigidly determined by one’s own internal state.
To avoid terminological equivocation, I shall refer to the property free in the
libertarian sense by the term ‘Free-Will’, and to the propertyfree in the compatibilist
sense by the term ‘Self-Willed’.
We are, undoubtedly, quite autonomous Self-Willed beings. However, not the
physicalist-compatibilist Self-Will but the libertarian Free Will can render phenom-
enal consciousness causally eﬃcacious. Are we, then, Free agents?

On scientists’ attitudes to the problem of Free Will
In the Middle Ages European intellectual life was subordinated to religious ide-
ology which concentrated upon the Free-Will aspects of existence and denied the
importance of studying lawful regularities present in the world. With the rise of
modern science when more and more laws holding in nature were discovered, and,
partly as an overreaction to religious dogmatism, the ‘scientiﬁc’ dogma of nomism
— the view that the behaviour of the world is thoroughly law-governed — began to
gain popularity. Already many scholars of the early modern scientiﬁc era, among
them Spinoza, Hobbes, Leibniz and Kant, accepted this view, and in recent times
the doctrine of the universal ruling of natural causality has won support by over-
whelming majority of scientists. This has led to the denial of the Freedom of Will.
Let us mention, for example, Albert Einstein’s ﬁrm antilibertarian convictions. In
modern times only very few scientists have dared to defend the explicitly libertarian
views. True, among those few have been such world-famous scholars as Sir Arthur
Eddington, Sir Charles Sherrington and Sir John Eccles.
Some scientists, ﬁnding it implausible to deny our being Free agents responsible
for our conduct, but believing at the same time that the dynamics of the physical
world are entirely regular, have suggested that even a truly Free-Will activity may
be compatible with the universality of lawful dynamics.
One of ideas aimed at justifying this suggestion has been proposed by Erwin
Schr¨ odinger (1977). He sought to avoid a contradiction between the (allegedly)
universal obtaining of the laws of nature and incontrovertible direct experience that
one oneself commands one’s motions, feeling full responsibility for them, by assuming
that every conscious mind controls the motion of the atoms according to the laws
of nature. However, if this thesis were true, then whatever claims that we are aware
of nonphysical aspects of our existence — including the claim that we, following
our Free decision, direct the motion of the atoms according to the laws of nature
— would be of no evidential import, because everything that we as material beings
would in this case do would have been done by us in exactly the same way also if
we were purely physical deterministically functioning creatures lacking phenomenal
consciousness and Free Will. Our producing assertions that we are introspectively
aware of possessing Free Will could be explained then as a result oflawful functioning
of our material bodies regardless of whether this lawful functioning is deterministic
or Freely evoked.
The other idea about how Free Will can be compatible with universally lawful dy-
namics is more sophisticated. It is argued (see, e.g., Hodgson, 1991, 1994, 1996) that
the Will can exercise its Freedom by selecting between alternatives which quantum
indeterminacy leaves open, preserving at the same time the physically lawful statis-
tics of sets of quantum events, so that, when described from a physical perspective
alone, Free Will looks like chance. However, in this case a Free agent cannot com-
mand its behaviour Freely according to its best discretion, but must merely play a
role of a generator of random events. The issuing of claims that one knows of having
Free Will would then be explainable as resulting from a combination of one’s lawful
and blindly random functioning, irrespective of whether such functioning is caused
by the physical determinism and randomness, or by one’s Free Volition. If the Will
directed quantum chance in its own aims, the lawful statistics of quantum events
5

would be violated — if not the low-order, then certainly the higher-order probability
distribution functions: the correlations of outcomes of individual quantum events
with the brain’s global state as it is represented in the content of consciousness
evoked by the brain.
The Free-Will behaviour I have in view when formulating a libertarian imperative
is the truly Free-Will behaviour which is not compatible with any kind of physically
lawful functioning of our bodies (brains). Our having of such Free Will is resolutely
denied by modern science.
Modern science assumes that the causal powers of mind consist in the causal
powers of its physical realisers. In all well-studied cases the dynamics of physical
reality have turned out to be deterministically or statistically strictly regular, and
it has been concluded that the laws of physics hold without exception. A typical
contemporary scientist maintains that there is not the slightest reason to doubt that
brains are anything other than machines with enormous numbers of parts that work
in perfect accord with physical laws, and that the principle of ‘could have done
otherwise’ should be dismissed as nothing better than a long-lived philosophical
illusion. There is claimed to be no such thing as Free Will, for it conﬂicts with the
principle of the causal closure of the physical world.
The possibility of Free Will is denied also on logical grounds. It is argued that a
Free act as an undertaking that has no suﬃcient causal condition is arbitrary, and
hence a random event one was not free to choose to occur. There are said to be only
two possibilities: either choices are determined or else they are random. The concept
of Free agency is regarded as incoherent or, at best, irremediably mysterious.
On the phenomenological evidence for Free Will
The arguments against Free Will are not decisive. That the brain functioning is
purely physically determined is not a scientiﬁcally established fact. It is merely as-
sumed that the brain, like other physical systems, is not interrelated with properties
of nonphysical origin, and hence cannot behave in a way dictated by Free Volition.
But we know that the brain, unlike (supposedly) simpler physical systems, is as-
sociated with one kind of nonphysical properties — with experiential qualia. Why,
then, is it implausible to think that the brain, unlike simpler physical systems, might
be associated with one more nonphysical property — with Free-Willness of activity
— that so well ﬁts in with phenomenal qualia the hedonic aspects of which form
the basis of ethics? The scientiﬁc argument against Free Will is not conclusive.
The logical argument against Free Will can also be questioned. That every event is
either causally determined or random, is not the innocent logical truth it appears to
be. The innocent logical truth is that every event is either causally determined or
not causally determined (Wiggins, 1973). The standard objection to libertarianism
fails to show that undetermined action would be random action.
In fact, every individual who has Free Will — Free-Will individual, for short —
has incontestable phenomenological evidence of his power to try to do otherwise,
to choose between genuine alternatives — a feeling of freedom. The experience of
volitional eﬀorts is not merely diﬀerent from other experiences (like pain, warmth,
fatigue, etc.), but it has a deﬁnite qualitative content from which it is self-evident
that these eﬀorts are free in the sense that one could have withheld from exerting
them. It is just for this reason that common sense ﬁnds it absurd to complain that
6

```text
one’s volitional eﬀorts don’t pass. Because of the direct phenomenological evidence
of the Freedom of one’s own Will, one’s being a Free agent is an incontrovertible
empirical fact, not merely a speculative hypothesis.
Regrettably, it is not at all ridiculous in the present-day philosophical atmosphere
to contend that the libertarian Free Will is an illusion, just a deceptive feeling that
cannot be taken seriously. There are two reasons why people of modern education
don’t regard as genuine the information contained in the qualitative content of the
feeling of freedom (see Uus, 1994). First, the experiences of volitional eﬀorts are not
publicly ascertainable and their qualitative content is not interpersonally communi-
cable, i.e. they belong to private reality, and people are trained to deem everything
subjective utterly dubious. Secondly, the intellectual abilities of phenomenal intu-
iting one needs for analysing the qualitative content of experiences are unnecessary
for contemporary, objectivistic science-making and are, therefore, ignored or even
derided.
Although the phenomenological evidence for Free Will is usually rejected on dog-
matic grounds as conﬂicting with the belief in the universal ruling of natural causal-
ity, even many libertarians tend to think as if it could not be seriously maintained
that we can know by introspection that we have Free Will. It should be admit-
ted that the acts of comprehending the phenomenological evidence for Free Will as
high-category mental processes can, indeed, be much more easily distrusted than
could simpler intellectual procedures. It would be therefore highly advantageous if
it were possible to reason about Free Will on the basis of much simpler concepts
than phenomenal qualia. There is such a possibility.
The Formulation of the Libertarian Imperative
Two aspects of the Free Will problem are discussed intensively by philosophers:
the conceptual aspect — what Free Will means and whether it is compatible with
determinism — and the epistemic aspect — how we can get to know the truth
about the presence of Free Will in the world. But a third important aspect of this
problem is neglected: the praxeological aspect — according to which belief about
possessing Free Will one should behave. True, in the majority of cases praxeology
is based directly on epistemic achievements: a claim that things are thus-and-so
is accepted as a grounding for reasonable activity only if there are empirical data
and/or theoretical considerations in favour of the proposition that things actually
are thus-and-so. However, in certain peculiar cases praxeology acquires priority
over epistemology. In such a case a proposition can be accepted as a basis for sound
behaviour solely because of the situation’s speciﬁc logical structure regardless of any
knowledge as to whether this proposition is true or false . The ideal limit of all such
cases is the unique situation of being faced with the problem of one’s own Freedom
of Will. The Free Will problem has a nonepistemic praxeological solution for the
reason that we can exercise our possible Freedom of Choice even while ignorant of
whether we have it.
I will now formulate a principle of behaviour which I call the Libertarian Impera-
tive. This Imperative is an answer to the question ‘Upon which belief about having
Free Will must a reasonable activity be based?’ and is thus a normative require-
ment that is reasonable or unreasonable relative to general aims of behaviour. In
7

formulating the Libertarian Imperative I assume that the supreme principle of the
person’s conduct is absolute honesty so that any intentional lying, even by noble
motives, is excluded.
By deﬁnition, the Libertarian Imperative is the requirement:
One must always try to act in accord with the
thesis that one has the libertarian Free Will.
Some comments. The Imperative says nothing about whether one is a Free-Will
being. The Imperative must be followed even if one knows that one’s behaviour has
always been deterministic. For all activity, except the justiﬁcation of the Imperative
itself, obeying the Imperative is equivalent to holding that one knows that one has
the libertarian Free Will. The main motive for advancement of the Libertarian
Imperative is that the claim ‘We must try to behave as if we knew that we have
Free Will’ can be justiﬁed by resorting to much simpler concepts than in justifying
the claim ‘We know that we have Free Will’.
The Justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative
In order to understand the explanation why the Libertarian Imperative must be
observed one has to master only two simple concepts: one of the basic concepts used
by science — the meaning of ‘lawful dynamics’ — and one of the basic commonsense
concepts — the meaning of ‘to try’ in everyday practical sense.
The concept of lawful dynamics
What is lawful dynamics is easy to understand in general, but the variety of it
that has most to do with the determinism–libertarianism issue — the deterministic
choice-making between alternatives — is occasioning much confusion. It is argued
that determinism does not preclude the making of choices, but it is often not realised
that the deterministic choice is fundamentally diﬀerent from the Free-Will choice.
The Free-Will choice is free in the sense that one could have selected a distinct
alternative from that which one actually selected. Quite otherwise, the deterministic
‘choice’ is not a choice between genuine alternatives. This point is expressed with
extreme clarity by Marvin Minsky (1986, p. 306):
According to the modern scientiﬁc view, there is simply no room at all for “freedom of the
human will.” . . . Everything, including that which happens in our brains, depends on these
and only on these:
A set of ﬁxed, deterministic laws. A purely random set of accidents.
. . . Whatever actions we may “choose,” they cannot make the slightest change in what might
otherwise have been – because those rigid, natural laws already caused the states of mind that
caused us to decide that way . And if that choice was in part made by chance – it still leaves
nothing for us to decide.
But many philosophers are muddling the issue by trying to produce an impression
as if there were no essential diﬀerence between deterministic and Free-Will choice.
Their aim is to ward oﬀ the threat to materialism arising from people’s introspective
awareness of their Freedom of Will. People ask: ‘What is free about my will if
I cannot make choices other than the ones I make’, and are inclined to regard
deterministic deliberation as a pale imitation of freedom.
Various tactics are used for selling deterministic choice for a genuine one. Some
8

argue that deterministic decision-making is not blind obeying of the rules, because
the latter evolve in the course of the system’s functioning. Others claim (see Ho,
1996) that organisms free themselves from the laws of physics by being coherent
wholes whose parts participate in the coordinated action. But however ‘dynamic’ or
‘holistic’ a deterministic process may be, at the basic level it is always determined
by blind following of fundamental rules — the laws of nature.
A vigorous eﬀort to argue for compatibilism is made by Dennett (1984). His
tactics are ingenious. Not believing in libertarian free will, he ﬁnds it reasonable to
redeﬁne the meanings of words and expressions traditionally used for discussing the
free will problem — unavoidable, inevitable, possibility, necessity, open future, can,
could have done otherwise, deliberation, free choice, free will, etc. — by assigning
them ‘useful’ content applicable only in the realm of lawful dynamics. Then a talk
about our allegedly nomic functioning sounds as a good old talk about Free-Will
behaviour and is likely to provoke no protest by unsophisticated common sense. And
more importantly, further arguing about Free Will is rendered impossible because
you now lack any words for relevant concepts — your tongue is amputated. However,
Dennett’s exertions to please common sense while staying faithful to physicalism
end, at a closer look, in ﬁasco. Admitting that we rightly dread such conﬁning
circumstances where our options are reduced to one, he oﬀers us two varieties of open
future: the epistemic one (being nescient of what will happen) and the probabilistic
one (being dynamically partly stochastic). To be free is to be ignorant or at the
mercy of blind chance — that is how we can have free will and science too, in
Dennett’s opinion.
If one’s behaviour is deterministic, then at every moment one has only one option
of acting, for this is what determinism means. The outcome of one’s deterministic
deliberation is ﬁxed both in its process and its ultimate product, and thus one
cannot prevent its occurrence. This truth is particularly clearly explained by Peter
van Inwagen (1983).
If one’s behaviour is partly probabilistic, then one produces also purely random
acts. In principle, one can, without violating the probabilistic law of dynamics,
behave in very many diﬀerent ways, provided, however, that the actual behavioural
pattern produced would have a blind-chance character satisfying this law.
Consequently, if one’s decision-making and other behavioural acts are law-gov-
erned, one cannot prevent their regular or purely random occurrence.
The commonsense meaning of trying
To understand what ‘to try’ means in an everyday pretheoretic sense is to understand
what one must do to obey such orders as: Try to raise your hand; Try to utter
‘Physicalism is fallacious’; Try to imagine a circle; etc. This presupposes possessing
practical abilities familiar to everybody to evoke various volitional eﬀorts. This does
not presuppose having any knowledge about the brain processes (or soul processes
if such exist) involved in voluntary acts of trying.
Why the Libertarian Imperative should be obeyed
The reason why we should always try to act as if we knew that we are Free agents
even if we actually don’t know this, is rather simple. I think most people are aware
of that reason subconsciously. Such awareness is implicitly evident in claims like:
9
```

## Page 10

```text
‘Any discussion is meaningless if there are no freely willing agents’, ‘Be kind to the
determinists for they have had no choice about what they think and write’, etc. I
shall explicate this reason as clearly as I can.
People usually think that it is sensible to try to act in accord with the thesis A
only if we know, or have at least some ground to suppose, that A is true. It seems
unbelievable that there can be cases when it is unconditionally reasonable to act
on the basis of the assumption A, while having no reason for holding that A rather
than not-A is true. But there are such cases. Here is a simple example.
Suppose an expedition has been sent to an alien planet with a task to explore its
ionosphere. By accident, all measuring equipment gets crushed in landing. However,
in spite of having learned absolutely nothing about the physical characteristics of the
planet’s ionosphere, the research team is, nevertheless, justiﬁed to try to forward to
the Earth the reports of the following type about these characteristics: ‘The planet’s
ionosphere transmits radio waves of the frequency used in sending this message’. The
issuing of such messages is justiﬁed because they don’t reach the addressee if false.
The attempts to send such messages can make things in the world only better (if the
messages are true) in the sense of how much true knowledge its inhabitants possess,
but not worse (if the messages are false).
The reason why in speciﬁc cases it is unquestionably sound to perform certain
acts in accordance with a premise of which we don’t know if it is right or wrong, is
purely logical: if the actual states of aﬀairs are in these cases such that our premise
is wrong, these same states of aﬀairs prevent our acts from being eﬃcacious. The
most elegant situation where this kind of impeccable soundness-maximising tactics
of behaviour are possible is that of being faced with the problem of one’s own
Freedom of the Will.
Our volitional eﬀorts are either nomic processes obeying at some fundamental
level deﬁnite deterministic or probabilistic laws of dynamics, or they are non-nomic,
Free acts exempt at any fundamental level of description from the laws of nature. If
our volitional activity is nomic, then: (i) if we maintain that our activity is nomic,
we are right; and (ii) if we maintain that our activity is Free-Volitional, we are
wrong, but we are wrong unavoidably , because we cannot then prevent the regular
or purely random law-governed occurrence of our mental and behavioural acts. If
our volitional activity is Free-Volitional, then: (i) if we maintain that our activity
is Free-Volitional, we are right; and (ii) if we maintain that our activity is nomic,
we are wrong, yet we are wrong not unavoidably , because as Free agents we could
have behaved otherwise, i.e. could have maintained that our volitional activity is
Free-Volitional.
Consequently, in order to behave in the most reasonable way possible (provided
we seek the truth) in respect to the Free Will problem, we must attempt to act
always in conformity with the thesis that we are Free-Will beings, for if we actually
are Free-Will beings, our such attempts cohere with the truth, and if we actually are
not Free-Will beings, whatever attempts by us are not the kind of acts that can make
things in the world either better or worse than they would otherwise be, because
then these attempts themselves belong to nature’s causal network and their lawful
occurrence, either deterministic or random, cannot be avoided. It is reasonable to
try to behave as a libertarian.
The strongest attack against the Libertarian Imperative can be worded as follows:
10

It is logically possible that it would be established some day that brain functioning
is strictly deterministic. Any sound person would then abandon the Libertarian
Imperative and would regret ever having obeyed it. Hence, the Imperative is not
an unconditionally obligatory principle of behaviour.
This oﬀensive, however, misses the point. Even if I were absolutely sure that my
brain functioning is deterministic, I would, nevertheless, try to argue that it is not.
If I succeed in doing so, I will be utterly wrong, of course, but neuroscientists will
console me by explaining that I could not have done otherwise unless the determin-
istic laws of brain dynamics were violated in my brain.
This attack would be to the point if the thesis ‘It is always reasonable to try to
behave as a libertarian’ were interpreted as follows: Of all logically possible states
in which a person of a given kind might be, it is epistemically more advantageous
for him to be in a state of trying to behave, or behaving, according to the belief
of having Free Will. It is undoubtedly epistemically disadvantageous to be a liber-
tarian when one’s functioning is deterministic in fact. The libertarian thesis should
be understood as follows: Given that one is the way one actually is , if one behaves
or will behave as a libertarian, one’s such behaviour is epistemically the most ad-
vantageous of all actually possible ways of behaviour even when one’s functioning
is in fact deterministic, because in the latter case there simply are no other nom-
ically possible alternatives to one’s actual behaviour. The libertarian thesis thus
construed is indefeasible.
The Speciﬁc Features of the Libertarian Imperative
The justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative is easily understandable because what
is justiﬁed in the ﬁrst place is not one’s attempt to claim that one’s behaviour is
Free-Volitional, but one’s trying to deny that one’s behaviour is lawful (unavoidable),
and the concept of lawful dynamics is much more easily comprehensible than that of
Free-Will activity. The simplicity of justiﬁcation of the Imperative may even create
an impression that it is a cheap sophistry.
The Libertarian Imperative is not an epistemic statement: it doesn’t assert that
one knows that he has Free Will. However, for the reason that the Imperative
requires one to try to behave on the basis of the thesis that he possesses Free Will,
obeying the Imperative is by its consequences to one’s activity equivalent to the
acceptance by him of the belief that he knows he has Free Will.
The Libertarian Imperative is ontologically general in the sense that it requires the
attempting to deny not only the physical (materialistic) universal determinateness
of one’s behaviour, but also any other kind of such determinateness, be it purely
spiritual, or forced by some kind of divine power, or whatever.
From the logical form of the justiﬁcation scheme of the Libertarian Imperative it
is evident that it can be applied extremely restrictedly — only for justifying those of
one’s own occurrent volitional eﬀorts which are aimed at presenting or investigating
these same eﬀorts as the exemplars of Free-Volitional acts. The logical basis of the
Imperative does not justify my trying to regard my other volitional acts, let alone the
behaviour of other individuals, as Free-Volitional. Any suggestions about the wider
domain of the Free-Will behaviour can only be scientiﬁc-hypothetically motivated.
Tentatively, but quite plausibly, I may hypothesize that just those of my acts that are
11
```

## Page 12

```text
accompanied by experiences of volitional eﬀorts are Free-Volitional, because there
are serious reasons to suggest that the qualitative content of my volitional eﬀorts
contains direct subjective evidence about their Free-Will character. As other persons
are by their physical buildup and behaviour rather similar to me, it is tenable to
think that the activity of all people in general is Free-Volitional to the same extent.
It is also appropriate to suggest that many other biological species, ﬁrst of all the
higher ones, have Free Will, too.
Trying to obey the Libertarian Imperative is, in essence, an experimental approach
to the Free Will problem. The Imperative can be viewed as the following call: let us
not speculate whether Free Will is theoretically possible; let us also not ask whether
we have any empirical evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free Will;
let us take, instead, a straightforwardly experimental approach to this problem —
let us try to behave as is appropriate to Free agents and see if we succeed in it. Such
experimenting is subject to a reliable protection mechanism: if it is foredoomed to
failure, it spoils nothing because it can’t be then executed at all. If our behaviour is
law-governed, we cannot experiment with it because we cannot then act otherwise
than we are forced to act according to these laws.
On the Metaphysical Possibility of Free Will
Although the possibility of Free Will is not a precondition for justifying the Libertar-
ian Imperative (as I explained above, obeying the Imperative is reasonable even in
the strictly deterministic world), it is, nevertheless, appropriate to wonder whether
Freedom of Will is at all conceivable. This question is a pressing one because of
the aforementioned plausible-looking logical (metaphysical) argument against the
possibility of Free Will. It is contended that Freedom is not possible in any kind of
possible world because our actions which are not necessitated by prior states of the
world have no cause and are thus fortuitous, and a fortuitous event is no kind of Free
choice. The libertarian view that a choice is Free only if it is not causally determined
by preceding events is regarded as obscure and obscurantic, if not incoherent.
I shall combat the metaphysical argument against Free Will from two angles.
First, I stress that the impossibility of devising an easily understandable deﬁnition
or explanation of what Free Will is is not decisive evidence that the concept of Free
Will is incoherent. There are universally accepted concepts that are, likewise, not
explicable in a simple way. Secondly, I show that the concept of natural causation,
even if applied to the most simple cases of the physically deterministic causation
processes, is rather controversial, and that a relevant analysis reveals that the con-
cept of natural causation is closely reminiscent of the concept of agent-causation
used to explain the meaning of Free-Will activity.
Irreducibility of the concept of Free Will
Some aspects of reality and concepts of these aspects are simple and easy to un-
derstand. Identity, diﬀerence, natural numbers, linear sequence, ﬂat space, regular
order, randomness, and the like are relatively simple, low-grade concepts. However,
there are also higher-grade concepts such as inﬁnity, time, consciousness, Free-Will
activity, omnipotence. It is impossible to downgrade the high-grade concepts to
the level of low-grade ones. This impossibility must not be regarded as a mark of
12
```

## Page 13

```text
incoherence of high-grade concepts. I shall give an example.
It is easy to understand what ‘to be actually the case’ means. The concept of
actual existence is easily comprehended. But if we try to explain what time is, we
have to use, in addition, the concept of past existence. Now, everything that belongs
to the past does not exist actually, in the same sense as what belongs to the present
does. Neither is the past a mere fabrication of fantasy. Some philosophers insist
that there can be no third possibility between actual existence and nonexistence,
and therefore time cannot have the property commonly regarded as intrinsic to it:
that only the present exists actually, while the past does not exist any more and the
future does not exist yet. They argue that time is like space, all its moments/points
— those of past, present and future — existing actually, ‘at once’, in exactly the
same way. However, there is no reason to think that from the irreducibility of
high-grade concepts of past and future existence to the level of lower-grade concepts
of actual existence and nonexistence it follows that the traditional intuitively well-
comprehensible concept of time is incoherent and therefore only the continua of
spatial type can exist.
Likewise, there is no reason to think that from the irreducibility of the high-grade
concept of Free-Will behaviour to the level of lower-grade concepts of lawful and
stochastic dynamics it follows that the intuitively well-comprehensible commonsense
concept of Free Will is incoherent. It is illegitimate to maintain that all basic aspects
of reality must be categorially trivial. Longing for a categorially simple world must
not blind us to the extent that we deny our most subtle intellectual capacities —
our abilities to comprehend the content of high-grade concepts.
The nontrivial character of the concept of natural causation
Those who argue that the concept of Free-Will behaviour is incoherent because the
only intelligible varieties of behaviour are allegedly the deterministic and random
ones, think that the concept of causally deterministic dynamics is simple. They
have hardly ever been interested in what causality really means and how it is meta-
physically possible.
The objective, natural sciences explore only the spatiotemporal formal structure
of the world: its abstract form and not its content (see Russell, 1927, p. 163; Carnap,
1969, pp. 19, 28, 107). The task of sciences is to discover the laws of nature — the
universal structural regularities present in the world — whereas the problem of
whether these laws are sustained, e.g., by the divine will or by the essence of the
material substance, is not the business of science but of metaphysics. Given that the
laws of nature as they are do hold ﬁrmly, the knowledge of how they are sustained has
no pragmatic signiﬁcance whatsoever. To extinguish the metaphysical curiosity, it
is suggested to rely upon the principle of parsimony by looking ﬁrst for the simplest
reasons, and to accept therefore the belief that the world’s order, including the
causal one, is guaranteed by the material substance itself. As the fundamental laws
of physics are relatively simple, people consider this belief to be reasonable, yet they
never wonder seriously how the causal process might work. Let us ask this question
then.
The causal sequence of the simplest type can be conceived as follows. There is
some state of aﬀairs S1 at the moment t1. Because of causality, S1 gives rise to
the state S2 an instant later, at the moment t2. How can this happen? Will S1
13
```

## Page 14

```text
cease to exist at t1 and S2 arise from nothing at t2, so that cause and eﬀect would
be temporally separated? Hardly so. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that the
causal process is continuous: the state S1 changes into the state S2. Admitting that
the change is something more than the mere possession of a sequence of diﬀerent
properties at diﬀerent times, i.e. that the pace of change of a state is itself a deﬁnite
characteristic of that state, we reach the following conclusion. While the trans-
formation of the state from S1 to S2 is determined purely logically by the state’s
pace of change, the causality in its substantial sense concerning the physical causal
‘activity’ of the material substance itself is eﬀective in determining one aspect of
the state — its pace of change — by other aspects of that state at the very same
moment. All fundamental equations of physical dynamics express just this depen-
dence, both sides of the equations referring to the physical situation at one and the
same moment. The substantial causal process consists not in the determination of
the present by the past, but in the self-determination of the present independently of
preceding conditions. Sounds like the ‘obscure and panicky’ metaphysics of libertar-
ianism? If one contends that the libertarian notion of an originative agent capable
of contributing something independently of antecedent causes and conditions is ob-
scure to a discomforting degree, if not positively mysterious, one has to concede
that then the ordinary concept of causation should also be regarded as ‘obscure’.
It is useful to bear in mind that the most traditional concept of causation is not
trivial, and is reminiscent of the libertarian concept of agent-causation according
to which the Free agents self-determine their own character partly independently
of their antecedent properties, being the prime movers or ﬁrst causes of their own
actions. The libertarian Free activity is not so disparate from the natural causal
process as it seems to be at the ﬁrst glance. Causation may well be compatible not
only with the deterministic choice but also with the Free-Will choice.
The Peirastic Rejection of Materialism
There are various empirically grounded arguments which question the validity of
materialism (see, e.g., Lowe, 1996; Uus, 1994). The argumentation used in justifying
the Libertarian Imperative gives us, in addition, a ﬁrm logical basis for challenging
materialistic ideology.
The Libertarian Imperative requires us to try to reject any philosophy about
our nature which claims that we are entirely lawfully functioning creatures. This
means that we must also try to regard materialism as fallacious. Such abandoning of
materialism, if we succeed in it, would not be epistemic: the Imperative is not based
on knowledge that our behaviour is not law-governed. Rather, such discarding of
materialism may be called peirastic (from the Greek word peirastikos: involving, or
performing, an attempt) because it is based on our ability, if we have it, totry to act
and act in this way, and is logically justiﬁed for the reason that if this our ability
is guaranteed by our Free Volition, we would be right in dismissing materialism,
and if our abandoning of materialism has taken place in the course of our physically
lawful functioning, then we were forced to act just this way in order not to spoil the
materialistically lawful character of the world’s dynamics.
The Libertarian Imperative urges us to discard the materialistic world view to-
gether with its dogmatic impact upon our scientiﬁc research programs. In partic-

ular, the Imperative urges us to try to reject the thesis that brains are just very
complicated physical organs whose dynamics obey the laws of physics, and accept,
instead, the view that the impact of phenomenal experiences upon the creature’s
overt behaviour is mediated by his Free Will.
We have nothing to lose but we may gain immensely if we dare to try to discard
materialism and profess libertarianism.
