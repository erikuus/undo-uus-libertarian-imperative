Thanks. Please could you include a short note for the "about authors" 
section.

Subject: correction 1 
 
Dear Anthony, 
 
I just finished checking the page proofs of my  
article "The Libertarian Imperative". 
 
First of all I would like to thank you very 
much for editing my paper. 
 
There are 4 places in the paper where some corrections 
could be made, but these are of rather cosmetic character, 
so that please feel free in deciding whether to make them  
or not. I will point to these possible corrections by  
sending you small graphic files with the text of the paper.  
To avoid confusion, I will send them in separate messages. 
 
Yours sincerely, 
Undo 
 
The first correction to the paper "The Libertarian 
Imperative": page 48, bottom. 
 
A new system of postal codes has been introduced in Estonia  
recently (the old system was a legacy of Soviet empire). For  
our observatory, the old code EE2444 has been replaced by 61602.  
However, I think that for a quite long time the post clerks  
will remember better the old system rather than the new one.  
So it is not so important to make this replacement.

The second/third correction to the paper "The Libertarian 
Imperative": page 49 bottom / page 50 top. 
 
I had copied a quotation taken from Chalmers' book from  
an article of another author. Now I have this book myself  
and I found out that the quotation has two errors  
(insignificant, though). Also, it would be better not to  
begin a new line after this quotation (but this would alter  
the page layout up to the page 55 inc). Anyway, this  
correction could also be omitted.

The 4-th correction to the paper "The Libertarian 
Imperative": page 52. 
 
When writing the paper I somehow forgot that British 
spelling is `neurone' rather than `neuron'. On page 52 
`neurons' could be replaced by `neurones' in 3 places.

The 5-th correction to the paper "The Libertarian 
Imperative": page 61. 
 
The word `aforementioned' should be deleted, as the 
passage to which it refers has been removed from the 
final version of the paper.
