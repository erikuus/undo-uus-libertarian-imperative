Subject: Re: JCS Paper

Dear Anthony:

With this email letter I send you the *pure* text (TEX paraphernalia removed) of my JCS paper "The Libertarian Imperative". To know how this text should be typographically designed, one has to look at the printed manuscript of the paper.

The words and strings of words to be printed in italics are enclosed into braces {}.

What is enclosed into brackets [] are comments (such as: footnote, quotation begins, quotation ends) for a typist.

A typographically peculiar word `Schro"dinger' appears twice in the text.

With best wishes,
Undo Uus
