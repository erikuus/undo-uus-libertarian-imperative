THE LIBERTARIAN IMPERATIVE
AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR CONSCIOUSNESS STUDIES
Undo Uus, Tartu Observatory, EE2444, Estonia. Email: uus@obs.ee
Abstract: The prevailing trend of deeming subjective experiences causally idle obfuscates
consciousness research: the epiphenomenal entities cannot be studied. The most ﬂexible
way for conscious experiences to be eﬃcacious is for them to serve as a basis for free action.
Regrettably, no objective evidence testiﬁes for this possibility and subjective feelings of
having free will are judged deceptive. In this paper I shall explain that if we seek the truth
we must for purely logical reasons, irrespective of theoretical ideas and empirical data about
the origin of our activity, follow the Libertarian Imperative — the demand to try always to
act in accord with the belief that one exercises the incompatibilist free volition. It follows
that one of the most fundamental tasks of consciousness studies is to try to establish how
— by the evoking of which physical events, and by the violating of which physical laws —
the free-will consciousness commands brain dynamics.
Our epistemic situation is agonizing. On the one hand, scientiﬁc observations strongly
suggest that the world is thoroughly physical — a huge system of relatively simple funda-
mental physical entities obeying deterministic or probabilistic laws of dynamics. On the
other hand, we are subjectively aware of undergoing phenomenal experiences and of being
free originative agents. But phenomenal consciousness and genuine, incompatibilist free
volition have no place in the physicalistic world picture, and, given the immense theoret-
ical and technical achievements of modern materialistic sciences, there is a tremendous
psychological pressure to deny their existence. It is no wonder that the scholarly com-
munity has almost entirely succumbed to this pressure. Fortunately, the darkest years
of dominance by militant materialism are over and the issue of consciousness has begun
to attract the attention it deserves.
The Tangled Rehabilitation of Consciousness
Discarding the belief in panphysical ontology
Although hardly anybody denies the existence of consciousness these days, many philoso-
phers try to explain it away by redeﬁning it in purely physicalistic formal-structural
terms (see Churchland, 1995; Dennett, 1991; Hardcastle, 1995). However, there is an
insuperable obstacle to these aspirations: the phenomenal qualitative character or qualia
of conscious experiences. The attempts to treat the qualia in the language of ortho-
dox physics are utterly unconvincing and doomed to failure because the qualia and the
formal-structural concepts of physics — whether about simple or extremely complicated
systems and processes — belong to entirely diﬀerent categories. For that reason ever
more philosophers admit that the phenomenon which has been traditionally called con-
sciousness and is now often called phenomenal consciousness has an intrinsic qualitative
content that does not ﬁt into the strictly physicalistic world scheme. They suppose that
the phenomenal consciousness is either like some sort of ‘ﬁeld’ — the ﬁeld of experience
— which exists over and above the physical reality, or it is the intrinsic qualitative essence
of physical entities themselves, as panpsychists have always suggested. Both these posi-
tions amount to the abandoning of the belief that the world is ontologically thoroughly
physical in the traditional sense.

Clinging to the belief in panphysical causality
Regrettably, the rehabilitation of consciousness has become tangled as the majority of
scholars who acknowledge the existence of phenomenal experiences try to save the basic
doctrines of the materialist world concept. They hold that the nonphysical constituents
and properties of reality do not interfere with the physically determined causal behaviour
of the world. By assuming that the physical domain is causally autonomous, the physical
world is theoretically safeguarded from any ‘marring’ impact from the extraphysical: the
existence and dynamics of the physical world are supposed to be exactly the same as in
the case of the purely physical world. Moreover, the physical domain is considered to
be not only causally autonomous but also causally suﬃcient — a ‘causal dictator’ of all
reality. It is held that the physical determines not only its own dynamics but also the
entire existence of the nonphysical (Searle, 1990; Chalmers, 1995, 1996). Though the
world is allowed to be ontologically heterogeneous, its causal thread is believed to be
homogeneous — completely physical.
The concept of epiphenomenal consciousness
The view that the nonphysical exists but is determined by the physical implies that
consciousness is causally impotent. This thesis of the epiphenomenality of consciousness
is explicitly advocated, e.g., by Frank Jackson (1982), David Lewis (1995) and David
Chalmers (1995, 1996).
The concept of epiphenomenal consciousness is not problematic in the case when con-
sciousness is some kind of ‘ﬁeld of experience’ distinct from physical reality. The situation
is more complicated when the phenomenal experience is the intrinsic content of the physi-
cal reality itself. In this case we are not justiﬁed in claiming that the phenomenal content
lacks any causal eﬃcacy: the content of physical entities determines their interaction and
dynamics. However, given the character of phenomenal qualia as we know them, and
the character of the laws of dynamics that are regarded as physical, we can legitimately
claim that the ‘physical’ qualia are causally idle (Uus, 1994, pp. 115–9). Any impact the
qualitative content of physical entities can have upon the behaviour of some system must
be entirely evident in the form of basic equations of dynamics of these entities. That the
highly complex qualia must be causally ineﬃcient when they are the noumenal essence
of the basic components of physical reality is evident from the fact that on the basis of
the fundamental laws of physics it is impossible to ﬁgure out which kind these qualia are.
Hence, the concept of epiphenomenal consciousness is intelligible also in the case when
the phenomenal experiences are the essence of the physical reality itself.
The fact-based science of epiphenomenal consciousness is logically impossible
The epiphenomenalist theories of consciousness have been criticized by several authors
(see Beloﬀ, 1994; Elitzur, 1995; Hodgson, 1994b, 1996a,b; Lowe, 1995; Warner, 1996),
most forcefully by Daniel Dennett (1991, pp. 398–406). The fatal defect of theories of
epiphenomena is that they cut themselves oﬀ from any empirical basis.
It is logically possible that our subjective experiences are causally inert. There is
also nothing counterlogical in advancing a theory that we actually have such-and-such
epiphenomenal experiences. It can even be agreed that everyone of us knows, by being
aware of one’s own experiences, that this theory is correct. But it is illogical to claim that
this kind of consciousness can serve as an empirical basis for our theoretical speculations
about it, or that we can issue assertions of evidential value for judging whether these
speculations have any bearing on reality. A defender of epiphenomenal consciousness is
2

justiﬁed to contend, as Chalmers (1996, p. 198) does:
I know I am conscious, and the knowledge is based solely on my immediate experi-
ence. To say that the knowledge makes no diﬀerence to my psychological functioning
is not to say the experience makes no diﬀerence to me.
But, on pain of self-contradiction, he cannot assure us that he asserts he knows he is
conscious because he knows he is conscious. He has to concede that according to his
own views his statement has been produced by his psychological (neurophysiological)
functioning no matter whether he in fact knows he is conscious.
The fact-based theories of epiphenomena are impossible for logical reasons.
The modern philosophy of consciousness in stalemate
The belief in the autonomy of the physical world spoils the endeavours to rehabilitate
the phenomenal consciousness. If a champion of phenomenal experiences believes in the
causal suﬃciency of physics, he must hold that the experiences are causally idle, and
in doing so, he exposes himself to ridicule by his physicalist adversaries and strips the
problem of phenomenal consciousness of any scientiﬁc import. If one argues like Chalmers
(1995) that there is the really hard problem of experiences but that explaining (i) the
access to one’s own internal states, (ii) the production of reports about mental events,
and (iii) the deliberate control of behaviour are all easy problems concerning only the
neurophysiological mechanisms and processes, one falls an easy prey to his physicalist
opponents who use an indefeasible logical argument to force him to admit that (i) the
‘really hard problem’ is, in fact, merely one of the ‘easy’ problems, since the reason why
the intellectual wrestling with the ‘hard problem’ arises and leads to deﬁnite conclusions
can be explained ‘easily’ as being the result of the neurophysiological processes alone, and
that therefore (ii) the concept of epiphenomenal experiences presents only as negligible
an interest to sciences as a hypothesis about the physical ﬁelds which surround material
particles but exert no impact on anything.
A majority of the proponents of phenomenal consciousness holds to the view that the
nonphysical is causally idle — the view called property dualism to tell it apart from the
interactionist or substance dualism — and for that reason most of the modern theories
of phenomenal consciousness are demolished by materialists before they get really oﬀ the
ground. The philosophy of consciousness is in a stalemate.
Can There Be the Science of Phenomenal Consciousness?
Dennett’s Dictum
From what has been said above it should be clear that any fact-based theory of phenom-
enal consciousness is incompatible with the doctrine of the causal closure of the physical
universe. The empirically grounded science of phenomenal consciousness is possible only
if the physical world is causally open. I shall call this proposition Dennett’s Dictum ,
because Daniel Dennett is the most outspoken and eﬀective propagator of this principle,
and sticks to it rigorously: by believing in the causal autonomy of physics, he denies
uncompromisingly that there can really be any phenomenology, any intrinsic qualia of
experiences.
The explicit exposition of Dennett’s Dictum is one of the most fundamental achieve-
ments of the philosophy of mind. This Dictum must be regarded as the cornerstone of
any logically sound philosophy of phenomenal consciousness.

A painful option: phenomenal consciousness vs. the modern scientiﬁc world view
Because of Dennett’s Dictum, the problem of experiences is far more serious than is
generally realized. Those who believe that the fact-based science of phenomenal con-
sciousness is possible are usually not aware that this requires abandoning the modern
scientiﬁc world view by denying the causal completeness of physics.
We face the dilemma: either the contemporary scientiﬁc world concept is correct and
there can be no fact-based theories of phenomenal consciousness, or there can be such
theories but then the basic nature of the world is utterly misdescribed by modern science.
The decision to forsake the well established world view would be so radical that we cannot
aﬀord to be thoughtless here. It is wise to discard the materialist world picture only if
there are very serious reasons to do so.
Are there plausible alternatives to the physically determined world?
Experiences can be causally eﬃcacious in two fundamentally diﬀerent ways. One possi-
bility is that phenomenal experiences are like some kind of ﬁeld which is in mutual in-
teraction with the physical world so that together they form a combined physical-mental
reality with dynamics that obey a deﬁnite set of natural laws (Libet, 1994; Smythies,
1994). Such a composite physical-mental world is of the same basic kind as the purely
material one in the sense that it is entirely law-governed. The other, much more extrav-
agant, possibility for phenomenal experiences to be causally eﬀective is for them to serve
as a basis or an environment for free-will activity.
The ﬁrst option — that the world is a law-governed composite physical-mental system
— is logically unproblematic, but we do not have any factual evidence in support of
it. Amazingly, there is suﬃcient ground for preferring the second option — the view
that we and other conscious creatures are free agents — to materialism, even though the
concept of free volition is supernatural, hard to comprehend, and logically problematic.
My main goal in this paper is to show that for simple logical reasons we are justiﬁed in
trying always to follow the thesis of being free agents, and hold that a fact-based science
of phenomenal consciousness is possible.
The Problem of Free Will
The libertarian and compatibilist concepts of the freedom of will
The term ‘freedom of will’ is used to denominate two quite diﬀerent properties.
Traditionally — and this is still the commonsense custom — the property of the will
called its freedom has been interpreted as the ability to select one actuality from several
possibilities, as the ability, for anything one tries to do, always to have tried to do
otherwise. Free will in this strong sense is incompatible with causal determinism, for the
latter rules out the possibility of a person’s trying to do other than what he does try.
Such incompatibilist, libertarian free volition transcends natural causality.
The other, modern tendency is to designate by ‘freedom of will’ the creature’s property
to function autonomously, to be free ofoutside coercion and constraint. The freedom thus
deﬁned is compatible with the complete causal necessitation of behaviour. A decision is
free in this compatibilist sense simply because it is one’s own decision, no matter how
rigidly determined by one’s own internal state.
To avoid terminological equivocation, I shall refer to the propertyfree in the libertarian
sense by the term ‘Free-Will’, and to the property free in the compatibilist sense by the
term ‘Self-Willed’.

We are, undoubtedly, quite autonomous Self-Willed beings. However, not the physi-
calist-compatibilist Self-Will but the libertarian Free Will can render phenomenal con-
sciousness causally eﬃcacious. Are we, then, Free agents?
The scientiﬁc and the logical argument against Free Will
Modern science assumes that the causal powers of mind consist in the causal powers
of its physical realizers. In all well-studied cases the dynamics of physical reality have
turned out to be deterministically or statistically strictly regular, and it has been con-
cluded that the laws of physics hold without exception. A typical contemporary scientist
maintains that there is not the slightest reason to doubt that brains are anything other
than machines with enormous numbers of parts that work in perfect accord with physical
laws (see Minsky, 1986, p. 288), and that the principle of ‘could have done otherwise’
should be dismissed as nothing better than a long-lived philosophical illusion (see Den-
nett, 1984a). There is claimed to be no such thing as Free Will, for it conﬂicts with the
principle of the causal closure of the physical world.
The possibility of Free Will is denied also on logical grounds. It is argued that a
Free act as an undertaking that has no suﬃcient causal condition is arbitrary, and hence
a random event one was not free to choose to occur. There are said to be only two
possibilities: either choices are determined or else they are random. The concept of Free
agency is regarded as incoherent or, at best, irremediably mysterious.
The arguments against Free Will are not decisive
That the brain functioning is purely physically determined is not a scientiﬁcally estab-
lished fact. It is merely assumed that the brain, like other physical systems, has no
properties of nonphysical origin, and hence cannot behave Free-Volitionally. But we
know that the brain, unlike (supposedly) simpler physical systems, is associated with
one kind of nonphysical properties — with experiential qualia. Why, then, is it so im-
plausible to think that the brain, unlike simpler physical systems, might be associated
with one more nonphysical property — Free-Voluntariness — which so well ﬁts in with
the phenomenal qualia whose hedonic aspects form the basis of ethics? The scientiﬁc
argument against Free Will is not conclusive.
The logical argument against Free Will can also be questioned. That every event is
either causally determined or random, is not the innocent logical truth it appears to
be. The innocent logical truth is that every event is either causally determined or not
causally determined (Wiggins, 1973). The standard objection to libertarianism fails to
show that undetermined action would be random action.
The phenomenological evidence that we are Free agents
Every individual who has Free Will — Free-Will individual, for short — has an incon-
testable phenomenological evidence of his power to try to do otherwise, to choose between
genuine alternatives — a feeling of freedom. The experience of volitional eﬀorts is not
merely diﬀerent from other experiences (like pain, warmth, fatigue, etc.), but it has a
deﬁnite qualitative content from which it is self-evident that these eﬀorts are free in the
sense that one could have withheld from exerting them. It is just for that reason that
common sense ﬁnds it absurd to complain that one’s volitional eﬀorts don’t pass. Because
of the direct phenomenological evidence of the Freedom of one’s own Will, one’s being a
Free agent is an incontroversible empirical fact, not merely a speculative hypothesis.

The unjustiﬁed denial of the phenomenological evidence for Free Will
Regrettably, it is not at all ridiculous in the present-day philosophical atmosphere to
argue as Dennett (1984b, p. 136) does that
those who claim to know that they have performed acts such that they could have
done otherwise in exactly those circumstances must admit that they proclaim this
presumably empirical fact without beneﬁt of the slightest shred of evidence, and
without the faintest hope of ever obtaining any such evidence.
It is contended that the libertarianist Free Will is an illusion, just a deceptive feeling
that cannot be taken seriously.
There are two main reasons why people of contemporary education don’t regard as
genuine the information contained in the qualitative content of the feeling of freedom
(see Uus, 1994). First, the experiences of volitional eﬀorts are not publicly ascertainable
and their qualitative content is not interpersonally communicable, i.e. they belong to
private reality, and people are trained to deem everything subjective utterly dubious.
Secondly, the speciﬁc intellectual abilities of phenomenal intuiting one needs for analysing
the qualitative content of experiences are unnecessary for modern objectivistic science-
making and are, therefore, ignored or even derisioned.
Is there any better way for reasoning about the Free Will problem?
Although the phenomenological evidence for Free Will is usually rejected on dogmatic
grounds as conﬂicting with the belief in the universal ruling of natural causality, even
many libertarians tend to think as if it could not be seriously maintained that we can
know by introspection that we have or that we do not have Free Will (see van Inwagen,
1983, p. 21). It should be admitted that the acts of comprehending the phenomenological
evidence for Free Will as high-category mental processes can, indeed, be much more
easily distrusted than could simpler intellectual procedures. It would be therefore highly
advantageous if it were possible to reason about Free Will on the basis of much simpler
concepts than phenomenal qualia. There is such a possibility.
The Libertarian Imperative
An ignored approach to the Free Will problem
Two aspects of the Free Will problem are discussed intensively by philosophers: the con-
ceptual aspect — what Free Will means and whether it is compatible with determinism
— and the epistemic aspect — how we can get to know the truth about the presence
of Free Will in the world. But a third important aspect of this problem is neglected:
the praxeological aspect — according to which belief about possessing Free Will one
should act. True, in the majority of cases praxeology is based directly on epistemology:
a claim that things are so-and-so is accepted as a grounding for reasonable activity only
if there are empirical data and/or theoretical considerations in favour of the proposition
that things actually are so-and-so. However, in certain peculiar cases praxeology gets
detached from epistemology by acquiring priority over it. In such a case a proposition can
be accepted as a basis for sound behaviour solely because of the situation’s speciﬁc logical
structure regardless of any knowledge as to whether this proposition is true or false . The
ideal limit of all such cases is the unique situation of being faced with the problem of
one’s own Freedom of Will. The Free Will problem has a nonepistemic praxeological
solution for the reason that we can exercise our possible Freedom of Choice even while
ignorant whether we have it.

Formulating the Libertarian Imperative
The presupposition. The Libertarian Imperative is an answer to the question ‘Upon
which belief about having Free Will must a reasonable activity be based?’ and is thus
a normative requirement that is reasonable or unreasonable relative to general aims of
behaviour. In formulating the Libertarian Imperative I assume that the supreme principle
of the person’s conduct is absolute honesty so that any intentional lying, even by noble
motives, is excluded.
The formulation. By deﬁnition, the Libertarian Imperative is the requirement:
One must always try to act in accord with the
thesis that one has the libertarian Free Will.
Comments. (i) The Imperative says nothing about whether one is a Free-Will being.
(ii) The Imperative must be followed even if one knows that one’s behaviour has always
been deterministic. (iii) For all activity, except the justiﬁcation of the Imperative itself,
obeying the Imperative is equivalent to holding that one knows that one has the liber-
tarian Free Will. (iv) The main motive for advancement of the Libertarian Imperative
is that the claim ‘We must try to behave as if we knew that we have Free Will’ can be
justiﬁed by resorting to much simpler concepts than in justifying the claim ‘We know
that we have Free Will’.
The Justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative
In order to understand the explanation why the Libertarian Imperative must be observed
one has to master only two simple concepts: one of the basic concepts used by science —
the meaning of ‘lawful dynamics’ — and one of the basic commonsense concepts — the
meaning of ‘to try’ in everyday practical sense. However, these simple concepts should
be mastered correctly.
The concept of lawful dynamics
What is lawful dynamics is easy to understand in general, but the variety of it that
has most to do with the determinism–libertarianism issue — the deterministic choice
(or the deterministic decision as a choice-making between alternatives) — is occasioning
much confusion. It is argued that determinism does not preclude the making of choices,
but it is often not realized that the deterministic choice is fundamentally diﬀerent from
the Free-Will choice. The Free-Will choice is free in the sense that one could have
selected a distinct alternative from that which one actually selected. Quite otherwise,
the deterministic ‘choice’ is not a choice between genuine alternatives. This point is
expressed with extreme clarity by Minsky (1986, p. 306):
According to the modern scientiﬁc view, there is simply no room at all for “freedom
of the human will.” . . . Everything, including that which happens in our brains,
depends on these and only on these:
A set of ﬁxed, deterministic laws. A purely random set of accidents.
. . . Whatever actions we may “choose,” they cannot make the slightest change in
what might otherwise have been – because those rigid, natural laws already caused
the states of mind that caused us to decide that way . And if that choice was in part
made by chance – it still leaves nothing for us to decide.
But many a philosopher are muddling the issue by trying to produce an impression as if
there were no essential diﬀerence between deterministic and Free-Will choice. Their aim
7

## Page 8

is to ward oﬀ the threat to materialism arising from people’s introspective awareness of
their Freedom of Will. People ask: ‘What is free about my will if I cannot make choices
other than the ones I make’, and are inclined to regard deterministic deliberation as a
pale imitation of freedom.
Various tactics are used for selling deterministic choice for a genuine one. Some argue
that deterministic decision-making is not blind obeying of the rules, because the latter
evolve in the course of the system’s functioning. Others claim (see Ho, 1996) that or-
ganisms free themselves from the laws of physics by being coherent wholes whose parts
participate in the coordinated action. But however ‘dynamic’ or ‘holistic’ a determin-
istic process may be, at the basic level it is always determined by blind following of
fundamental rules — the laws of nature.
A vigorous eﬀort to argue for compatibilism is made by Dennett (1984b). His tactics
are ingenious. Not believing in libertarian free will, he ﬁnds it reasonable to redeﬁne the
meanings of words and expressions traditionally used for discussing the free will prob-
lem — unavoidable, inevitable, possibility, necessity, open future, can, could have done
otherwise, deliberation, free choice, free will, etc. — by assigning them ‘useful’ content
applicable only in the realm of lawful dynamics. Then a talk about our allegedly nomic
functioning sounds as a good old talk about Free-Will behaviour and is likely to provoke
little protest by unsophisticated common sense. And more importantly, further argu-
ing about Free Will is rendered impossible because you now lack any words for relevant
concepts — your tongue is amputated. However, Dennett’s exertions to please common
sense while staying faithful to physicalism end, at a closer look, in ﬁasco. Admitting that
we rightly dread such conﬁning circumstances where our options are reduced to one, he
oﬀers us two varieties of open future: the epistemic one (being nescient of what will
happen) and the probabilistic one (being dynamically partly stochastic). To be free is
to be ignorant or at the mercy of blind chance — that is how we can have free will and
science too, in Dennett’s opinion.
If one’s behaviour is deterministic, then at every moment one has only one option of
acting, for this is what determinism means. The outcome of one’s deterministic deliber-
ation is ﬁxed both in its process and its ultimate product, and thus one cannot prevent
its occurrence. This truth is particularly clearly explained by Peter van Inwagen (1983).
If one’s behaviour is partly probabilistic, then one produces also purely random acts.
In principle, one can, without violating the probabilistic law of dynamics, behave in very
many diﬀerent ways, provided, however, that the actual behavioural pattern produced
would have a blind-chance character satisfying this law. Consequently, if one’s decision-
making and other behavioural acts are law-governed, one cannot prevent their regular or
purely random occurrence.
The commonsense meaning of trying
To understand what ‘to try’ means in a platitude pretheoretic sense is to understand what
one must do to obey such orders as: Try to raise your hand; Try to utter ‘Physicalism
is fallacious’; Try to imagine a circle; etc. This presupposes possessing practical abilities
familiar to everybody to evoke various volitional eﬀorts. This doesnot presuppose having
any knowledge about the brain processes (or soul processes if such exist) involved in
voluntary acts of trying.
Why the Libertarian Imperative should be obeyed
The reason why we should always try to act as if we knew that we are Free agents even if
we actually don’t know this, is very simple. I think most people are aware of that reason
8

subconsciously. Such awareness is evident, though not in a rigorously articulated form,
in claims like: ‘Any discussion is meaningless if there are no freely willing agents’, ‘Be
kind to the determinists for they have had no choice about what they think and write’,
etc. I shall explicate this reason as clearly as I can.
People usually think that it is sensible to try to act in accord with the thesis A only if
we know, or have at least some ground to suppose, that A is true. It seems unbelievable
that there can be cases when it is unconditionally reasonable to act on the basis of the
assumption A, while having no reason for holding that A rather than not-A is true. But
there are such cases. Here is a simple example.
Suppose an expedition has been sent to an alien planet with a task to explore its
ionosphere. By accident, all measuring equipment gets crushed in landing. However,
in spite of having learned absolutely nothing about the physical characteristics of the
planet’s ionosphere, the research team is, nevertheless, justiﬁed to try to forward to
the Earth the reports of the following type about these characteristics: ‘The planet’s
ionosphere transmits radio waves of the frequency used in sending this message’. The
issuing of such messages is justiﬁed because they don’t reach the addressee if false. The
attempts to send such messages can make things in the world only better (if the messages
are true) in the sense of how much true knowledge its inhabitants possess, but not worse
(if the messages are false).
The reason why in speciﬁc cases it is undoubtedly sound to perform certain acts in
accordance with a premise we don’t know is right or wrong, is purely logical: if the actual
states of aﬀairs are in these cases such that our premise is wrong, these same states of
aﬀairs prevent our acts from being eﬃcacious. The most elegant situation where this
kind of impeccable soundness-maximizing tactics of behaviour is possible is that of being
faced with the problem of one’s own Freedom of the Will.
Our volitional eﬀorts are either nomic processes obeying at some fundamental level
deﬁnite deterministic or probabilistic laws of dynamics, or they are non-nomic, Free acts
exempt at any fundamental level of description from the laws of nature. If our volitional
activity is nomic, then: (i) if we maintain that our activity is nomic, we are right; and
(ii) if we maintain that our activity is Free-Volitional, we are wrong, but we are wrong
unavoidably, because we cannot then prevent the regular or purely random law-governed
occurrence of our mental and behavioural acts. If our volitional activity is Free-Volitional,
then: (i) if we maintain that our activity is Free-Volitional, we are right; and (ii) if we
maintain that our activity is nomic, we are wrong, yet we are wrong not unavoidably ,
because as Free agents we could have behaved otherwise, i.e. could have maintained that
our volitional activity is Free-Volitional.
Consequently, in order to behave in the most reasonable way possible (from the view-
point of pursuing the truth) in respect to the Free Will problem, we must attempt to
act always in conformity with the thesis that we are Free-Will beings, for if we actually
are Free-Will beings, our such attempts cohere with the truth, and if we actually are
not Free-Will beings, whatever attempts by us are not the kind of acts that can make
things in the world either better or worse than they would otherwise be, because then
these attempts themselves belong to nature’s causal network and their lawful occurrence,
either deterministic or random, cannot be avoided. Or, to put it diﬀerently, it is uncon-
ditionally reasonable, provided we seek the truth, to try to behave as a libertarian, for if
we attempt to defend the Free Will thesis in the situation that renders this defense futile,
i.e. when we are not Free-Will creatures, this same situation prevents our attempts from
being eﬃcacious ‘commanders’ in the world, able to divert the course of events oﬀ the
track along which it proceeds by the force of natural laws.

Indefeasibility of the Libertarian Imperative
The strongest attack against the Libertarian Imperative can be worded as follows:
It is logically possible that it would be established some day that brain functioning
is strictly deterministic. Any sound person would then abandon the Libertarian
Imperative and would regret ever having obeyed it. Hence, the Imperative is not
an unconditionally obligatory principle of behaviour.
This oﬀensive, however, misses the point. Even if I were absolutely sure that my brain
functioning is deterministic, I would, nevertheless, try to argue that it is not. If I succeed
in doing so, I will be utterly wrong, of course, but neuroscientists will console me by
explaining that I could not have done otherwise unless the deterministic laws of brain
dynamics were violated in my brain.
This attack would be to the point were the Imperative based on a thesis that it is
always reasonable to be a libertarian: it is undoubtedly irrational to be a libertarian
when one is aware of his deterministic functioning. But the Imperative is based on a
thesis that it is always reasonable, given that one is what one actually is , to try to be
a libertarian. The Libertarian Imperative thus construed is indefeasible because the
following propositions are unassailably true: (i) nomically functioning beings cannot act
otherwise than they do; (ii) the pursuing of libertarianism by Free-Will beings is the
pursuing of truth; therefore, (iii) given that one is the way one actually is, trying to
follow the Imperative may make the proportion of truth-concordant to misbeliefs-based
behaviour in the world only better than it would otherwise be.
On the Metaphysical Possibility of Free Will
Although the possibility of Free Will is not a precondition for justifying the Libertarian
Imperative (as I explained above, obeying the Imperative is reasonable even in the strictly
deterministic world), it is, nevertheless, appropriate to wonder whether Freedom of Will
is at all conceivable. This question is a pressing one because of the mentioned above
plausible-looking logical (metaphysical) argument against the possibility of Free Will.
It is contended that Freedom is not possible in any kind of possible world because our
actions which are not necessitated by prior states of the world have no cause and are
thus fortuitous, and a fortuitous event is no kind of Free choice. The libertarian view
that a choice is Free only if it is not causally determined by preceding events is regarded
as obscure and obscurantic, if not incoherent.
How to argue for the metaphysical possibility of Free Will?
I shall combat the metaphysical argument against Free Will from two angles.
First, I stress that the impossibility of devising an easily understandable deﬁnition or
explanation of what Free Will is is not decisive evidence that the concept of Free Will is
incoherent. There are universally accepted concepts that are, likewise, not explicable in
a simple way, and in the case of which the attempts to construct such explications have
led to fallacious conclusions as if these concepts were logically incoherent.
Secondly, I show that the concept of natural causation, even if applied to the most
simple case of the physical causation process, is controversial, and that a relevant analysis
reveals that the concept of natural causation is closely reminiscent of the concept of agent
causation used to explain the meaning of Free-Will activity.

Irreducibility of the concept of Free Will
Some aspects of reality and concepts of these aspects are simple and therefore easy
to understand. Identity, diﬀerence, natural numbers, linear sequence, ﬂat space, regular
order, randomness, and the like are relatively simple, low-grade concepts. However, there
are also higher-grade concepts such as inﬁnity, time, consciousness, Free-Will activity,
omnipotence. It is impossible to downgrade the high-grade concepts to the level of
low-grade ones. This impossibility must not be regarded as a mark of incoherence of
high-grade concepts. I shall give an example.
It is easy to understand what ‘to be actually the case’ means. The concept of actual
existence is easily comprehended. But if we try to explain what time is, we have to use,
in addition, the concept of past existence. Now, everything that belongs to the past does
not exist actually, in the same sense as what belongs to the present does. Neither is the
past a mere fabrication of fantasy. Some philosophers insist that there can be no third
possibility between actual existence and nonexistence, and therefore time cannot have
the property commonly regarded as intrinsic to it: that only the present exists actually,
while the past does not exist any more and the future does not exist yet. They argue
that time is like space, all its moments/points — those of past, present and future —
existing actually, ‘at once’, in exactly the same way. However, there is no reason to
think that from the irreducibility of high-grade concepts of past and future existence to
the level of lower-grade concepts of actual existence and nonexistence it follows that the
traditional intuitively well-comprehensible concept of time is incoherent and therefore
only the continua of spatial type can exist.
Likewise, there is no reason to think that from the irreducibility of the high-grade
concept of Free-Will behaviour to the level of lower-grade concepts of lawful and stochas-
tic dynamics it follows that the intuitively well-comprehensible commonsense concept of
Free Will is incoherent. It is illegitimate to maintain that all basic aspects of reality
must be categorially trivial. Longing for a categorially simple world must not blind us
to the extent that we shall deny our most subtle intellectual capacities — our abilities
to comprehend the content of high-grade concepts.
The nontrivial character of the concept of natural causation
Those who argue that the concept of Free-Will behaviour is incoherent because the only
intelligible varieties of behaviour are allegedly the deterministic and random ones, think
that the concept of causally deterministic dynamics is simple. They have hardly ever
been interested in what causality really means and how it is metaphysically possible.
The objective, natural sciences explore only the spatiotemporal formal structure of the
world: its abstract form and not its content (see Russell, 1927, p. 163; Carnap, 1969,
pp. 19, 28, 107). The task of sciences is to discover the laws of nature — the universal
structural regularities present in the world — whereas the problem of whether these laws
are sustained, e.g., by the divine will or by the essence of the material substance, is not
the business of sciences but of metaphysics. Given that the laws of nature as they are
do hold ﬁrmly, the knowledge of how they are sustained has no pragmatic signiﬁcance
whatsoever. To extinguish the metaphysical curiosity, it is suggested to rely upon the
principle of parsimony by looking ﬁrst for the simplest reasons, and to accept therefore
the belief that the world’s order, including the causal one, is guaranteed by the material
substance itself. As the fundamental laws of physics are relatively simple, people consider
this belief to be reasonable, yet they never wonder seriously how the causal process might
work. Let us ask this question then.

The causal sequence of the simplest type can be conceived as follows. There is some
state of aﬀairs S1 at the moment t1. Because of causality, S1 gives rise to the state S2
an instant later, at the moment t2. How can this happen? Will S1 cease to exist at t1
and S2 arise from nothing at t2, so that cause and eﬀect would be temporally separated?
Hardly so. Rather, it is reasonable to assume that the causal process is continuous: the
state S1 changes into the state S2. Admitting that the change is something more than
the mere possession of a sequence of diﬀerent properties at diﬀerent times, i.e. that the
pace of change of a state is itself a deﬁnite characteristic of that state, we reach the
following intriguing conclusion. While the transformation of the state from S1 to S2 is
determined purely logically by the state’s pace of change, the causality in its substantial
sense concerning the physical causal ‘activity’ of the material substance itself is eﬀective
in determining one aspect of the state — its pace of change — by other aspects of that
state at the very same moment . All fundamental equations of physical dynamics express
just this dependence, both sides of the equations referring to the physical situation at
one and the same moment. The substantial causal process consists not in the determina-
tion of the present by the past, but in the self-determination of the present independently
of preceding conditions. Sounds like the ‘obscure and panicky’ metaphysics of libertar-
ianism? If one contends that the libertarian notion of an originative agent capable of
contributing something independently of antecedent causes and conditions is obscure to
a discomforting degree, if not positively mysterious, one has to concede that then the
ordinary concept of causation should also be regarded as ‘obscure’. It is useful to bear
in mind that the most traditional concept of causation is not trivial, and is reminiscent
of the libertarian concept of agent causation according to which the Free agents self-
determine their own character partly independently of their antecedent properties, being
the prime movers or ﬁrst causes of their own actions. The libertarian Free activity is
not so disparate from the natural causal process as it seems to be at the ﬁrst glance.
Causation may well be compatible not only with the deterministic choice but also with
the Free-Will choice.
Lack of Private Honesty May Obstruct Scientiﬁc Progress
Libertarianism as an experimental approach to the Free Will problem
The Libertarian Imperative can be viewed as the following call: let us not speculate
whether Free Will is theoretically possible; let us also not ask whether we have any
empirical evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free Will; let us take, instead,
a straightforwardly experimental approach to this problem — let us try to behave as is
appropriate to Free agents and see if we succeed in it. Such experimenting is subject to an
absolutely reliable protection mechanism: if it is foredoomed to failure, it spoils nothing
because it can’t be then executed at all. If our behaviour is, in fact, law-governed, we
cannot experiment with it because we cannot then act otherwise than we are forced to
act according to these laws.
A claim of being unable to obey the Libertarian Imperative
An antilibertarian may concur that the Libertarian Imperative is indeed a legitimate
ﬁrst principle of truth-seeking behaviour. He may even agree that he is able, in princi-
ple, to perform any particular behavioural act necessary for obeying the Imperative, such
as uttering various claims in defense of libertarianism, executing diﬀerent operations in
conducting the scientiﬁc research aimed at discovering which laws of physics are violated
12

by brain dynamics, etc. Yet he may contend that he is not able to support libertari-
anism in any systematic manner, because he is a lawfully functioning system currently
not ‘programmed’ to behave this way and is therefore immune to the ‘brain-computer
virus’ called Libertarian Imperative. The premises of the Imperative do not rule out the
possibility that he might be right. But is he right? This question raises the issue of
honesty about private matters.
The concepts of public and private honesty
Suppose an ingenious scientist has devised an experiment for demonstrating that one
cherished principle of physics does not hold universally. If at some critical moment in
the course of the experiment a control button is pressed a novel result ensues, but if the
button is not touched nothing noteworthy happens. The scientists are oﬀered to use the
device themselves to become convinced that the unusual event will indeed take place.
But suppose further that most scientists are so unwilling to concede any violation of
the accepted orthodoxy that they withhold from pressing the button when required, yet
insist that they did and claim that the experiment has failed to provide any new evidence.
In the given case one can turn to impartial persons asking them to check whether the
buttons are pushed in fact. But what if such public control is impossible? This is just
the case with volitional eﬀorts: only the person himself who is supposed to try to exercise
volitional eﬀorts can know if he in fact does so.
For the sake of brevity, I shall call the honesty about matters which are publicly
accessible the public honesty , and the honesty about matters which are only privately
accessible the private honesty. One can be, in principle, evidentially accused of not being
publicly honest in any particular case, but one’s deliberate deceit in private matters
cannot be exposed by others.
Private honesty as a possible precondition of further scientiﬁc progress
There is admirably little fraud in scientiﬁc practice. The reason why it has been possible
to keep the natural scientists’ professional ethical standard exceptionally high is that all
steps of the objective scientiﬁc inquiry (observing, experimenting, theorizing, etc.) must
be accessible to public inspection — such is the methodological requirement of objective
sciences. The honesty with respect to objective scientiﬁc matters is exclusively the public
honesty subjectible to eﬀective interpersonal control. As this fact is generally known,
people at large are convinced that human moral imperfection cannot bring their scientiﬁc
pursuits to a mess like their various other endeavours that it has frequently thwarted.
However, this may not be the case any more.
If conscious beings possess Free Will then true progress in consciousness research is
possible only when we follow — and then we deﬁnitely can follow — the Libertarian
Imperative by acting in accordance with the thesis that our brain dynamics are to a
substantial degree Free-Volitional. But if in this case the scientists, though understanding
the reasonability of the Imperative, nevertheless deceptively maintain, due to lack of
private honesty, to be unable to try to act, and act, as is proper to Free-Will individuals,
the advancement of consciousness studies would be blocked. Moreover, if living beings
possess Free Will, the most fundamental direction of scientiﬁc research would be the
investigation of everything related to voluntary behaviour, so that in this case private
honesty is one of the most important preconditions of further scientiﬁc progress. If we are
Free-Will beings, our scientiﬁc self-exploration is as vulnerable to our moral defectiveness
as is human performance in many other areas of life.

The Speciﬁc Features of the Libertarian Imperative
The justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative is easily comprehensible
The logic of justiﬁcation of the Libertarian Imperative is easily understandable because
what is justiﬁed in the ﬁrst place is not one’s attempt to claim that one’s behaviour is
Free-Volitional, but one’s trying to deny that one’s behaviour is lawful (unavoidable), and
the concept of lawful dynamics is much more easily comprehensible than that of Free-
Will activity. Such justiﬁcation is analogous to antithetic proofs: in certain cases some
thesis can be proved not by showing, in the ﬁrst place, that it is true, but by showing
that its alternative(s) cannot be true. The simplicity of justiﬁcation of the Imperative
may even create an impression that it is a cheap sophistry.
The Libertarian Imperative is only self-applicable
From the logical form of the justiﬁcation scheme of the Libertarian Imperative it is
evident that it can be applied extremely restrictedly — only for justifying those of one’s
own occurrent volitional eﬀorts which are aimed at presenting or investigatingthese same
eﬀorts as the exemplars of Free-Volitional acts. The logical basis of the Imperative does
not justify my trying to regard my other volitional acts, let alone the behaviour of other
individuals, as Free-Volitional.
The ontological generality of the Libertarian Imperative
The Libertarian Imperative is ontologically general in the sense that it requires the
attempting to deny not only the physical (materialistic) universal determinateness of
one’s behaviour, but also any other kind of such determinateness, be it purely spiritual,
or forced by some kind of supernatural (demonic, divine) power, or whatever.
The epistemic-statement power of the Libertarian Imperative
The Libertarian Imperative is not an epistemic statement: it doesn’t assert that we know
that we have Free Will. However, for the reason that the Imperative requires us to try
to behave on the basis of the thesis that we possess Free Will, obeying the Imperative is
by its consequences to our activity equivalent to the acceptance by us of the belief that
we know that we have Free Will.
The Peirastic Rejection of Materialism
The Libertarian Imperative requires us to try to reject any philosophy about our nature
which claims that we are entirely lawfully functioning creatures. Given the present philo-
sophical situation in the world, the most topical ideological implication of the Imperative
is that we must try to regard materialism as fallacious. Such abandoning of materialism,
if we succeed in it, would not be epistemic: the Imperative is not based on knowledge
that our behaviour is not law-governed. Rather, such discarding of materialism may be
called peirastic (from the Greek word peirastikos: involving, or performing, an attempt)
because it is based on our ability, if we have it, to act in this way, and is logically justiﬁed
for the reason that if this our ability is guaranteed by our Free Volition, we would be
right in dismissing materialism, and if our abandoning of materialism is necessitated by
our physically lawful functioning, then we are forced to act just this way in order not to
spoil the materialistically lawful character of the world’s dynamics. The Libertarian Im-
perative compels us to discard the materialistic world view together with all it’s speciﬁc
impact upon our scientiﬁc research programs.

The Implications of the Libertarian Imperative for Consciousness Studies
The generalizings of recommendations of the Libertarian Imperative
The Libertarian Imperative justiﬁes, strictly speaking, only the claim by an activity that
it itself is Free-Volitional. Any suggestion about the wider domain of the Free-Will
behaviour cannot be purely logically justiﬁed. It can only be scientiﬁc-hypothetically
motivated, and this is what I am going to proceed with.
As I am justiﬁed to consider some of my acts Free-Volitional, I am justiﬁed to hold
that I am a Free-Will being, and therefore it is proper to wonder to what extent my
behaviour is Free-Volitional. It is scientiﬁcally reasonable to try to establish what kinds
of my activity might be commanded by my Free Will. Tentatively, but quite plausibly,
I may hypothesize that just those of my acts that are accompanied by experiences of
volitional eﬀorts are Free-Volitional, because there are serious reasons to suggest that
the qualitative content of my volitional eﬀorts contains direct subjective evidence about
their Free-Will character.
As other persons are by their physical buildup and behaviour rather similar to me, it
is tenable to think that the activity of all people in general is Free-Volitional to the same
extent. It is scientiﬁcally highly reasonable to generalize the request of the Imperative
by hypothesizing that all human beings are Free-Will creatures.
It is also appropriate to suggest that many other biological species, ﬁrst of all the
higher ones, have Free Will, too.
The public scientiﬁc manifestations of Free-Will activity
The possible intrinsic essence of Free-Will behaviour — such as the qualitative content
of volitional eﬀorts — cannot be studied by objective scientiﬁc methods. But one very
important aspect of Free-Will activity is amenable to public scrutiny: this is the nonlaw-
ful character of the physical brain processes underlying our Free-Will behaviour. In the
brains of Free-Will beings the basic laws of physics must be violated to a signiﬁcant
degree, and this can be established by objective methods.
A distinctive feature of consciousness-evoking brain processes
It is commonly agreed that in normal conditions the consciousness-evoking brain pro-
cesses have deﬁnite impact upon the creature’s overt behaviour — the impact mediated
by phenomenal experiences which form the basis of voluntary activity. In the case of
humans such activity may be, e.g., the production of reports about the occurrence and
character of experiences. Only the acts of overt behaviour can serve as basic empirical
data for objective scientiﬁc exploration of phenomena of consciousness, and thus also of
consciousness-evoking properties of brain processes. This position is sound in every sense
and cannot be questioned.
However, because we are justiﬁed, due to the Libertarian Imperative, to reject the
thesis that brains are just very complicated physical organs whose dynamics obey the
laws of physics, and accept, instead, the view that the impact of phenomenal experiences
upon the creature’s overt behaviour is mediated by his Free Will, we can conclude that
a distinctive feature of consciousness-evoking brain processes is that normally they do
not cause our behaviour via neural (purely physical) mechanisms . This is a very impor-
tant implication of the Libertarian Imperative for cognitive sciences, because it sharply
contradicts the basic assumptions of materialistically motivated consciousness and brain
research programs, including the presently most famous Crick-Koch project of visual
awareness studies.

The ideological bias of Crick’s and Koch’s studies of visual awareness
Resorting to recommendations of the Libertarian Imperative and their generalizations,
I can criticize Francis Crick’s and Christof Koch’s consciousness studies (see, e.g., Crick
and Koch, 1992, 1995a,b; Crick, 1994, 1996) for serious ideological bias.
Crick’s and Koch’s consciousness research program, aimed at ﬁnding out where the
neurons responsible for conscious awareness are located in the brain, and in what way
they are ﬁring, is, I would dare say, the most fundamentally important of all contemporary
scientiﬁc endeavours.
This research project is basically empirical. There are our visual sensations of which
we are empirically (experientially) directly aware, and which we are able to report. And
there are our brain processes which we can also discover empirically. The research task
is to establish, by means of ﬁnding out correlations between stimuli-evoked brain events,
on the one hand, and conscious experiences (or, in case of animals, behavioural acts as
eﬀects of these experiences), on the other hand, which brain processes are necessary and
suﬃcient for existence of visual sensations.
Proper scientiﬁc attitude does not allow one’s theoretical sympathies to interfere with
empirical studies. Crick and Koch sin against this principle. They take for granted that
the causal chain stimulus-evoked brain processes—phenomenal experiences—behavioural
reaction to phenomenal experiences is realized physiologically, by neural networks: they
assume that phenomenal experiences are speciﬁc activities of certain sets of interacting
neurons. Given the counterintuitive character of this assumption — it is extremely
diﬃcult, not to say impossible, to consider the phenomenal qualia to be just the same
things as the patterns of neural ﬁrings (even Crick himself complains of impossibility of
comprehending how the blueness of blue can be scientiﬁcally explained) — it is highly
imprudent to apply this assumption as a basis for experimental research which does not
even need it in the ﬁrst place. Such faithfulness to physicalistic ideology may spoil the
research project in question.
Crick and Koch argue (1995a) that if a group of neurons does not project to the brain’s
motor areas responsible for our reporting on what we experience then the activities of
these neurons do not contribute to immediate visual awareness directly, and, relying upon
this thesis, they deny that a certain set of neurons, though activated by visual stimuli,
can give rise to visual sensations. This thesis is inferred from two propositions: from
the commonsense observation that one is able to report one’s subjective experiences, and
from the materialistic hypothesis that brain functioning is physically explainable. The
ﬁrst proposition cannot be questioned because we know from ﬁrst-hand experience it to
be true but the second proposition is suspicious.
The process of reporting consciousness could be physically explained only if subjective
experiences were physical processes. Stipulating this to be the case, I would suggest to
Crick and Koch a simple exercise for testing their methodology: take some sophisticated
robot and elucidate which processes in its electronic ‘brain’ are which subjective expe-
riences. The architecture of the robot’s brain and the way it processes information are
known in full detail. Is it then an easy empirical task to ﬁnd out which information-
processing patterns are correlated with which subjective experiences? Not so? But why
not if experiences are nothing but speciﬁc patterns of physical processes? And why is
it impossible, as also Crick and Koch admit (1995b), to convey with words and ideas
the exact nature of a subjective experience, while everything about the neuronal activ-
ity associated with this experience is conveyable with words and ideas, if subjective
experiences are nothing over and above neuronal processes?

In view of the chronic troubles with reconciling the commonsense insight into the nature
of consciousness with physicalistic doctrines, it is wise to listen to what the Libertarian
Imperative has to say about this problem. Relying on recommendations of the Imperative
and their generalizations, one is justiﬁed to say the following.
Our voluntary behaviour is Free and cannot therefore be determined by physical causal-
ity but must be the result of an impact of nonphysical origin upon our brain. As our
reactions to experiences are predominantly voluntary, one of the basic characteristics of
experience-evoking brain processes is that they do not cause our responses to experiences
via neuronal mechanisms. (This conclusion doesn’t depend even on whether experiences
are brain processes or something else.) Hence, if one holds like Crick and Koch (1995a)
that the activity of the neurons which do not project to the brain’s motor areas can-
not be directly responsible for consciousness, then one erroneously excludes from the
list of possible consciousness-evoking brain processes also all those processes which are
directly responsible for consciousness. If Crick and Koch remain faithful to materialistic
ideology they will never reach the goals of their research and fail to make a revolution-
ary empirical discovery that no neuronal causal link connects consciousness-evoking and
behaviour-generating brain events.
The blockade of important discoveries by scientiﬁc prejudices is not an unknown phe-
nomenon in the history of science. Take the story of the discovery of nonconservation of
parity in microphysical processes (Franklin, 1979). The parity conservation was strongly
believed in by the physics community until two physicists proposed in 1956 that it may
be violated in the weak interactions. After a couple of months this hypothesis was exper-
imentally corroborated. In retrospect it has been established that certain experiments
performed as early as 1928 provided evidence for the parity nonconservation, but at that
time there was absolutely no recognition of their signiﬁcance. The two physicists were
29 and 34 when they proposed the hypothesis worthy of the Nobel Prize. I wonder
how young should those neuroscientists be who dare to challenge materialistic doctrines,
fearless of losing face for reneging cherished beliefs.
The most fundamental brain research problem
One of the main objectives of brain research should be elucidating which brain events
the Free-Will eﬀorts evoke: how the Will modiﬁes the activity of neuronal networks in
deﬁance of natural causes. These investigations would be the most fundamentally impor-
tant of all presently conceivable scientiﬁc inquiries, because while hitherto the principal
task of natural sciences has been believed to be the discovering universal regularities —
the laws of nature — in the behaviour of the world, the object of these novel investiga-
tions would be a ‘supernatural’ phenomenon: causal impact of Free-Will eﬀorts upon the
dynamics of matter. That we are able to execute our volitionally intended behavioural
acts very reliably notwithstanding that the brain works under conditions of rather high
hydrodynamical, chemical/biological, and thermal noise, that it is not shielded from dis-
turbing electromagnetic ﬁelds, etc. means that the physical eﬀects which are induced by
Free-Will eﬀorts and steer the brain’s neuronal-level processes cannot be very weak and
might thus be relatively easily discovered.
The exploration of Will-elicited brain events is not the duty of neuroscientists alone,
but also of investigators from all those ﬁelds of research which can contribute productively
to the study of that most intriguing of all scientiﬁc problems. Much help here should
come from the technically and intellectually powerful physics community. The problem
of causal eﬃcacy of Free Will is intimately tied with the question about the intrinsic
essence and fundamental properties of physical reality.

Freedom of the Will and quantum indeterminism
Although empirical investigations and not theoretical speculations can establish how
Free Will in fact interferes with the brain’s physically lawful dynamics, a very plausible
hypothesis about this process is worth mentioning.
Materialists, trying to discredit the concept of Free Will, usually caricature the possi-
ble interference of immaterial Will with brain dynamics as an awkwardly rough process.
They argue, for example (Dennett, 1991, p. 35), that manipulating the brain’s func-
tioning would necessarily require the expenditure of physical energy, and would thus
violate the conservation of energy principle. This is not true. The Free-Will behaviour
can be realized in the physical medium so elegantly that although on the one hand the
laws of physics would be evidently violated , on the other hand such behaviour would
not be deﬁnitely barred by the laws of physics. This is the case when the Will exercises
its Freedom by selecting between alternatives that quantum indeterminacy leaves open.
Arthur Eddington (1929) was the ﬁrst to point at this possibility. This idea has been de-
fended, among others, by John Eccles and Karl Popper, and is presently most vigorously
advocated by David Hodgson (1991, 1994a,b, 1996a,b).
When the Will directs quantum chance in its own aims, the lawful statistics of sets of
quantum events would be violated — if not the low-order distribution functions, then
certainly the higher-order ones: the correlations of outcomes of individual quantum events
with the brain’s global state as it is represented in the content of consciousness evoked
by the brain. However, since the nature of statistical laws is diﬀerent from that of
deterministic laws, any possible single outcome of a quantum process is not prohibited by
the laws of quantum physics. Even of ensembles of Will-determined selections of quantum
events we cannot assert with absolute certainty that they violate the probabilistic law
as from the strictly formal viewpoint such ensembles may be the very-low-probability
instances of blind quantum chance.
The hypothesis that Free Will guides brain dynamics in a subtle manner by deter-
mining what the laws of nature leave indeterminate should deserve more attention by
neuroscientists than various hypotheses which assume the mind to be some kind of non-
physical psychic ﬁeld exerting ﬁnite physical force upon the brain’s physical constituents.
However, one may contend that the commanding by Will of quantum chance is a mysti-
cal process and therefore incredible. It is true that our Will doesn’t directly determine
the outcomes of quantum processes: we are consciously aware that our volitional ef-
forts are not aimed at making such decisions. If our Will indeed operates via choosing
between quantum options, there must be something hidden from us which transforms
our volitional intentions envisioned in everyday notions into a myriad of quantum-level
microselections necessary for eﬀectuating these intentions. In principle, it might be pos-
sible to discover this ‘something’. In that connection it should be mentioned that the
purely physical quantum chance is also a mystical phenomenon, and even such that it
is logically impossible to ﬁnd any deeper explanation to it. According to the concept
of quantum chance there is no internal mechanism, no hidden parameters — no reason
whatsoever — why a particular event of all possible quantum events occurs: the outcome
is occasional simply because of a speciﬁc unanalysable fundamental property of physical
reality. Yet this probabilistic essence, though unanalysable, somehow interplays with
various spatial, temporal and energetic properties of physical processes in determining
their concrete statistical characteristics. Isn’t that mystical? One should be cautious in
regarding everything that seems mystical as incredible: even the primitive metaphysics
of the material world is mystical.

An Appeal To Scientists:
Not To Hinder Scientiﬁc Progress,
Discard Materialism, and Profess Libertarianism!
Modern science is loyal to the materialistic world concept that may be, however, in error
as it fails to account for phenomenal consciousness. If consciousness is, as common sense
tends to hold it to be, a causally eﬃcacious nonphysical entity, then belief in materialistic
doctrines blocks the most fundamental directions of scientiﬁc research.
Immaterial consciousness could be causally signiﬁcant by serving as the basis of Free-
Will activity. But are we justiﬁed in assuming the possession of Free Will? This problem
has, fortunately, a simple praxeological solution for the reason that we are able to exercise
our incompatibilist, libertarian Freedom of Choice, if we have it, even while remaining
ignorant as to whether we do have it. We can argue as follows.
Let us not speculate whether Free Will is possible metaphysically. Let us not ask if we
have any empirical evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free Will. Let us
take an experimental stance and try whether we can behave as is appropriate for Free
agents. If we do lack Free Will, such experimenting spoils nothing because we cannot
then experiment with our behaviour at all as we then would be unable to act otherwise
than determined. If we have Free Will, we will succeed in acting as libertarians and such
behaviour is then justiﬁed as congruent with the truth.
Regrettably, the enchantment with the successes of physicalistic sciences has created
an intellectual atmosphere utterly hostile to nonmaterialistic views, and therefore it is
psychologically extremely diﬃcult to be obedient to reason and to try honestly to act in
the libertarian manner: one has every reason to be afraid of destroying one’s scientiﬁc
reputation, and many may dislike losing face by forsaking their avowed convictions.
Realizing that we may have entered an era when the lack of scholarly integrity may
impede scientiﬁc advancement, I feel obliged to step forward with the following appeal:
Dear Scientists,
In order not to hinder possible major scientiﬁc and intellectual advancement of
humankind,
let us try earnestly to abandon materialism and advocate libertarianism,
for the reason that our such attempts are justiﬁed not only in the case when we
in fact possess Free Will, but also in the case when we are law-governed physical
beings because then any eﬀorts we manage to exercise are particular manifestations
of nature’s lawful causal order, and had thus to be necessarily exercised not to break
this order,
and for the reason that if we remain faithful to materialistic doctrines we run
the great risk — in view that we may actually have the libertarian Free Will — of
simulating the intellectual conduct appropriate to physically deterministic intelligent
creatures very perfectly, and defending the antilibertarian claims very ingeniously,
just owing to our possession of immaterial consciousness and Free Will, thereby
spitting into the well we are drinking from, and gravely obstructing the progress of
sciences.
We have absolutely nothing to lose but we may gain immensely if we dare to
discard materialism and profess libertarianism. Our wisdom, probity and courage
are crucial for how this challenge is met.
