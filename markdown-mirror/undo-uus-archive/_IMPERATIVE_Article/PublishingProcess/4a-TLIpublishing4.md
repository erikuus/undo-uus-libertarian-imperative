Dear Keith,

Have you received 3 copies of the revised version of my article on the Libertarian Imperative I posted for you 4 weeks ago? Do you need any additional copies?

Yours,

Yes thanks, read it on the plane to Denmark, and I did have a couple of comments, which I'll send on later today (been a bit busy since I returned!) -- Keith

three further comments:

1) The JCS house-style does not lend itself to a large number of subheadings, so almost all of these would need to be removed. I agree that it makes for a nice punchy reading style, but more conservative scholars will say that this is too polemical, too journalistic and interrupts the flow of the argument. So we need to have only the main headings and essential subheadings (have a look at typical JCS articles to see what I mean here).

2) I think it is essential to remove the section "private honesty and scientific progress" before we send it out for peer review.

3) I imagine you will be unhappy with this final suggestion, but I also recommend the removal of the final section "the main implications..." The reason is that progress towards radical conclusions like your own have to be taken in small, measured steps. The arguments of your paper are made with due caution, but the final section moves into a whole new territory, that would need far greater support than can be provided within the confines of a short paper.

Basically the first point that has to be accepted is that consciousness studies has exposed materialism as a bankrupt ontology. Only once this is more broadly accepted can we move on to speculate as to what the scientific implications of this are.

My hope is that the special issue as a whole will encourage people to move away from the current consensus and start to take the role of intentionality and Free Will seriously. The reason that Dave Chalmers has caused such an impact is because he has moved into hostile territory with due caution. There is a great danger that your paper would be rejected by a referee on account of its immodest conclusions, and this would be a great shame.

Obviously the final decision on this is with you.

Best wishes

-- Keith

Subject: Re: JCS Referee report

Dear Undu

I sent your last draft out to a sympathetic referee and enclose his report. I think you should take his thoughtful and well-intended criticisms very seriously, but at the same time he acknowledges (with great honesty) that he has his own particular line of critique which is somewhat different from your own. Obviously it is important that the paper be directly related to consciousness studies.

I appreciate that it's very difficult to know how best to proceed when critiques come in from all kinds of different angles. But this is an important and highly controversial area so we should expect this, and we want to ensure that your arguments (and the special issue as a whole) come over in the best possible way.

Dear Keith,

Herewith I send you two copies — one JCS-formatted and another double-spaced — of the revised manuscript of my article. If you need any additional copies, please tell me, I will then post them for you immediately.

As we agreed upon, I removed most of subheadings (of the former 34 subheadings I retained only 7), and omitted sections `private honesty...' and `the main implications...'.

The places where I made some minor changes in the text of the article are marked on the regularly spaced copy of the manuscript.

With best wishes, ´
Undo Uus
