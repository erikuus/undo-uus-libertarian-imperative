Dear Keith: 
 
I very much appreciate the valuable criticisms and suggestions 
made by a referee. I will revise my article accordingly. I think 
I will cut back somewhat the first part (directly related to 
consciousness) of the paper and will stress more strongly the 
connection between the problems of consciousness studies and  
free will. 
 
(Yesterday I posted for you 2 copies of the article revised as 
we agreed upon earlier this week. These are now, of course, 
obsolete.) 
 
Best regards, 
Undo

Many thanks for being so understanding, and look forward to your revised 
submission in due course -- no great hurry.  Am I not right though in 
thinking the referee recommended to extend and develop the first part, 
or did I get that wrong?  And of course it's up to you to decide what 
strategy suits you best.

Dear Undo 
 
Sorry we've been out of touch so long, other imperatives got in the way, 
but now we are back on course with the JCS special issue on free will 
and volition.  We need to send your submission to Ben Libet, the guest 
editor and also Joseph Goguen, our ed-in-chief.  In fact my colleague 
Anthony Freeman sent it to Libet yesterday, but I have a feeling that 
your last version is lost somewhere in the junk-heap that is sitting on 
my desk.  Would you mind sending us another 3 copies of the final 
version and, to ensure Libet gets to read your final version, send him a 
copy by express airmail, with a covering letter saying that this is the 
final revised version, and you are sending it at the request of Anthony 
Freeman of JCS (I'll fax to warn him of this).

One other thought.  We never ran a book review in jcs of Lowe's 
"Subjects of Experience".  How would you like to do a review?  I'm 
enclosing your earlier comments on the book to remind you, and also my 
own THES piece in case you wanted to steal anything

Dear Keith: 
 
You couldn't have found the last version of my paper on your desk 
because I have only just now completed it. I am very sorry for 
delaying so long with it, but I have waited for prof-s Timothy 
Sprigge's and Robert Kane's comments on my paper and then revised 
it quite substantially. I will send the copies of the last version 
of the paper to you and prof. Libet within a few days. 
 
I will consider also your inviting proposal to write a review of 
Lowe's book, and will tell you about my decision soon. 
 
Best wishes, 
Undo

Phew, that's a relief -- I thought I'd lost it!

That's great, thanks.  I'm particularly glad that you have consulted 
Sprigge.

Thanks.  I can return the book for you to have another look.

Dear Keith, 
 
You need not send Lowe's book to me: I made a copy of it 
for myself when it was in my hands.
