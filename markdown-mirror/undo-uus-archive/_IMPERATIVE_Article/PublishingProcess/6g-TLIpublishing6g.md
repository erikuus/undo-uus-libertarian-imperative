Subject: The Libertarian Imperative 
 
Dear Undo 
 
The August/September issue ended up heavily over-booked, so we had to 
take the decision to defer some of the articles to the October issue. We 
took this decision on the grounds of overall editorial balance and  
decided to include the articles by yourself and Jean Burns (one of the 
JCS editors) in the October issue. 
 
This means in effect that you will get twice the exposure, as less than 
half the subscribers have opted to purchase the August/September issue  
(it is one of the additional supplements), whereas October is a regular 
issue that goes to all 2300 subscribers. Also if it's any consolation my 
own piece for the volition issue didn't even get past the referees! 
 
best wishes

Dear Keith 
 
I regard it advantageous for me that my article will be 
published in a regular issue of the JCS rather than in 
a supplement. 
 
It is a pity that you had a bad luck with your own paper 
on volition: I very much like your unorthodox position on 
the free will problem known to me due to your participation  
in JCS-online discussions. 
 
With best wishes,

Dear Anthony, 
 
I received your letter with the page proofs of my article 
"The Libertarian Imperative" yesterday (in fact, the letter 
had arrived in Estonia already 5 days ago). I will check the 
proofs and will notify you about the results this afternoon. 
 
Yours sincerely,
