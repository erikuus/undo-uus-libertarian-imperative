Thank you very much. Our TEX conversions are not always successful, so I 
think using your pure text alongside the printed copy (which I already 
have) will be safer. 
 
I will send you the proofs in due course. 
 
Best wishes, 
Anthony.

Dear Anthony: 
 
A year ago Keith Sutherland suggested that I might write a review 
of Jonathan Lowe's book ″Subjects of Experience.'' I am very sorry 
for such a long delay with responding to Keith's proposal. Anyway, 
enclosed you find what has come out of my attempt to review the book. 
 
       With best regards,   
       Undo Uus
