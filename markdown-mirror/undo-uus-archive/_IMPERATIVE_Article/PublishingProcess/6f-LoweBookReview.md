E. Jonathan Lowe
Subjects of Experience
Cambridge: CUP, 1996, x + 209 pp., £ ??.??
ISBN 0-521-47503-1 (hbk).
In Lowe’s book one can witness a clash of ideas
about the nature of conscious beings: the au-
thor is torn by the persuasiveness of the intu-
itive, commonsense comprehension of one’s own
basic essence, and by the attractiveness of the
simple, naturalistic notion of sentient creatures.
He hopes to reconcile these apparently diﬀerent
conceptions and present a picture of human sub-
jects which is naturalistic, metaphysically co-
herent and consistent with subjective intuitions.
Holding to a realist view of the mental and ap-
proaching the problem of consciousness in em-
piricist tradition he unembarrassingly professes
the views regarded by many as old-fashioned.
Lowe advocates very convincingly the causal,
representative theory of perception. His lu-
cid explication of essential diﬀerences between
perceiving and having perceptual experiences,
and between phenomenal and doxastic senses of
‘look’ or ‘appear’ is particularly illuminating to
a reader.
Proceeding from a realist attitude towards
subjective experiences, Lowe highlights the im-
portance of their sensuous aspects for mental ac-
tivity by defending a plausible thesis that a true
intentionality and genuine cognition must ulti-
mately be grounded in phenomenal content of
sensations. Thought, he concludes, is not lin-
guistic but imaginative: at the most fundamen-
tal level we ‘think in ideas’, and this ideational
thinking is non-discursive. It is impossible to
endow a computer with genuine cognitive states
without equipping it with suitable sense modal-
ities.
Observing that experiences are individuated
by their subjects, Lowe explains that our own
thoughts and experiences, when present and
conscious, are not presented to us as objects
of our awareness, but as constituents of it. He
further explicates that thoughts and experiences
are ‘adjectival’ upon the self, and that only a cer-
tain sort of substantival theory of the self can do
justice to this fact.
Lowe avows of rejecting any variety of phys-
icalism, even in its mildest non-reductionist
guises, as a basis for a scientiﬁcally and philo-
sophically acceptable account of human beings,
as subjects of experience, thought and action.
Intuition tells Lowe, like, I suppose, many of
us, that mental states have independent causal
powers, that persons or selves who think, feel
and act intentionally are not identical with their
bodies or brains. Lowe argues that the capac-
ity for perception and agency does not of its
nature reside in any sort of cerebral condition.
Recognising the power of mental events to make
a diﬀerence to how the world goes over and
above any diﬀerence made by physical events,
he claims of discarding both token-token iden-
tity theories and supervenience theories of men-
tal events and processes, and defending, instead,
a variety of interactionist dualism.
This is a radical claim: if one wants to con-
sistently hold to it, one has to admit that the
laws of physics must be violated to a deﬁnite
degree in processes involving mental causation,
because otherwise there would be no mental cau-
sation over and abovespeciﬁc intricate patterns
of physical causation. Lowe, however, balks at
making such an “unscientiﬁc” assertion and con-
cedes that every physical event has purely physi-
cal antecedent causes so that a principle of phys-
ical causal closure is satisﬁed. As a result, his
notion of mental causation turns out to be a
(non-reductionist) physicalistic notion. When
he asserts that his view of the causal status of
the mental is not compatible with a superve-
nience theory of mental states, he is logically
inconsistent for if every event has purely phys-
ical causes, there can never be a mental diﬀer-
ence without an underlying physical diﬀerence,
and therefore mental events cannot have inde-
pendent causal powers. Lowe’s contention as if
the principle ‘the same brain event — the same
mental episode’ were not making sense since it
is impossible to practically replicate brain states
misses the point. By the similar argument one
might question also the soundness of the notion
of physical causation ‘the same physical event —
the same physical eﬀect’, and abandon as mean-
ingless also the principle of physical causal clo-
sure. Lowe’s claim that causal explanation in
mentalistic terms can still be regarded as au-
tonomous with respect to physical explanation,
on the grounds that mentalistic explanations in-
voke generalisations which are not at all salient
at the purely physical level, is a classical non-
reductionist physicalistic claim.
Lowe tries to distance himself from physical-
ism also in another way that, too, is rather du-

bious. He says he rejects the reductionist view
that a tree can simply be regarded as being
nothing over and above an assemblage of sub-
atomic particles, for these particles constitute
a tree rather than an entity of some quite dif-
ferent non-biological kind because of their par-
ticular organisation. However, no reductionist
is so stupid as to argue that a tree is merely
an unstructured assemblage of particles. Ev-
ery physicalist regards a tree as a speciﬁcally
organised system of particles in a speciﬁc dy-
namical state. Regrettably, nowadays it is quite
a widespread custom to ﬁrst caricature physi-
calism as a foolish philosophy and then present
correct physicalistic views as a non-physicalistic
position. The attractiveness of the elegant and
simple physicalistic world view is so strong that
hardly anybody dares to oppose its basic prin-
ciples.
One may seriously doubt whether Lowe has
succeeded in elaborating a naturalistic but non-
physicalistic theory of the self. In fact, Lowe
himself is also not pretentious in this respect: he
sees his work as an attempt to begin to answer,
rather than to entirely solve, the posed prob-
lems. He admits that general human intelligence
is a big mystery. Nevertheless, Lowe’s book is
remarkable. Although Lowe accepts the basic
physicalistic doctrines, he, unlike the physical-
ists, does also justice to intuitively comprehensi-
ble subjective facts, and brings the conclusions
drawn from these inescapable facts into direct
confrontation with modern physicalistic (natu-
ralistic) beliefs about the nature of subjects of
experience, so that a reader has a rare oppor-
tunity to witness the historical clash of ideas in
the form it has when it takes place within the
bounds of a single mind. It is like seeing the
battle from the very centre of the battleﬁeld.
Lowe’s book leaves it up to everyone of us with
which of conﬂicting ideas to take sides, and in
making up one’s mind it is important to follow
Lowe’s advice not to let uncritical metaphysical
preconceptions obscure one’s choice.
