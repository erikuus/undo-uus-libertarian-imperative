An Appeal To Scientists:
Not To Hinder Scientiﬁc Progress, Discard Materialism, and Profess Libertarianism! Modern science is loyal to the materialistic world concept that may be, however, in error as it fails to account for phenomenal consciousness. If consciousness is, as common sense tends to hold it to be, a causally eﬃcacious nonphysical entity, then belief in materialistic doctrines blocks the most fundamental directions of scientiﬁc research. Immaterial consciousness could be causally signiﬁcant by serving as the basis of Free-Will activity. But are we justiﬁed in assuming the possession of Free Will? This problem has, fortunately, a simple praxeological solution for the reason that we are able to exercise our incompatibilist, libertarian Freedom of Choice, if we have it, even while remaining ignorant as to whether we do have it. We can argue as follows. Let us not speculate whether Free Will is possible metaphysically. Let us not ask if we have any empirical evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free Will. Let us take an experimental stance and try whether we can behave as is appropriate for Free agents. If we do lack Free Will, such experimenting spoils nothing because we cannot then experiment with our behaviour at all as we then would be unable to act otherwise than determined. If we have Free Will, we will succeed in acting as libertarians and such behaviour is then justiﬁed as congruent with the truth. Regrettably, the enchantment with the successes of physicalistic sciences has created an intellectual atmosphere utterly hostile to nonmaterialistic views, and therefore it is psychologically extremely diﬃcult to be obedient to reason and to try honestly to act in the libertarian manner: one has every reason to be afraid of destroying one’s scientiﬁc reputation, and many may dislike losing face by forsaking their avowed convictions. Realizing that we may have entered an era when the lack of scholarly integrity may impede scientiﬁc advancement, I feel obliged to step forward with the following
appeal:

. Dear Scientists, In order not to hinder possible major scientiﬁc and intellectual advancement of humankind, let us try earnestly to abandon materialism and advocate libertarianism, for the reason that our such attempts are justiﬁed not only in the case when we in fact possess Free Will, but also in the case when we are lawgoverned physical beings because then any eﬀorts we manage to exercise are particular manifestations of nature’s lawful causal order, and had thus to be necessarily exercised not to break this order, and for the reason that if we remain faithful to materialistic doctrines we run the great risk — in view that we may actually have the libertarian Free Will — of simulating the intellectual conduct appropriate to physically deterministic intelligent creatures very perfectly, and defending the antilibertarian claims very ingeniously, just owing to our possession of immaterial consciousness and Free Will, thereby spitting into the well we are drinking from, and gravely obstructing the progress of sciences. We have absolutely nothing to lose but we may gain immensely if we dare to discard materialism and profess libertarianism. Our wisdom, probity and courage are crucial for how this challenge is met.
