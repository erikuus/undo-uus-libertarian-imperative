Editorial note Undo Uus asks which world view — materialistic or nonmaterialistic — is correct. This difficult philosophical question has troubled péople since the ancient times. Regrettably, science has abandoned impartiality when dealing with this most essential problem and has started passionately and even dishonestly to defend materialism, suppressing or denying the facts that discredit this worldview. Present-day science, acknowledging only the sc. objective methods of research and the materialist worldview, has been dealing competently with a vast range of processes of nature, thus facilitating extensive progress of science and technology. But having taken a one-sided stance on the basic philosophical problem, science ignores the extremely interesting nature of the phenomena of consciousness and, therefore, cannot see the new fundamental trends of research which could be already developed in a very resultative way. If science could rid itself of its dogmatic narrow-mindedness, its role as the main force determining the development of human society and its prestige among the public would considerably rise. A number of arguments exist which point concretely at the flaws in the treatment of world by present-day science, but these arguments are based on relatively complicated notions, and therefore orthodox science has been quite successful at neutralising them. The author is convinced that easily understandable reasoning could help us get rid of the insular perception of the world. In his article he attempts to present an argumentation of this kind.; 2201.
