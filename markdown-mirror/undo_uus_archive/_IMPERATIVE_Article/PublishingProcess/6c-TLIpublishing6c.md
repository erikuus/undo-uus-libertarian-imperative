Subject: Re: JCS Paper 
 
 
 
Dear Anthony: 
 
With this email letter I send you the *pure* text (TEX paraphernalia 
removed) of my JCS paper "The Libertarian Imperative". To know how 
this text should be typographically designed, one has to look at the  
printed manuscript of the paper. 
 
The words and strings of words to be printed in italics are enclosed  
into braces {}.  
 
What is enclosed into brackets [] are comments (such as: footnote, 
quotation begins, quotation ends) for a typist. 
 
A typographically peculiar word `Schro"dinger' appears twice in the 
text.  
 
With best wishes, 
Undo Uus
