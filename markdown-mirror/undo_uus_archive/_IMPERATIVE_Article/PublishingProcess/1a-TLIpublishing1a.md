Hello Mike! 
 
 I send you two copies of the manuscript of my philosophical paper, which I will 
try to submit to the Journal of Consciousness Studies. The copy with regular spacing is 
for you personally.  
I would be very grateful, if you coul d make corrections to the copy printed in 
double spacing, and return it to me (I enclose a label with my postal address). There is 
no hurry with this article. 
 
Thanking in advance, 
Undo

     Dear Undo,      
     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
      
        On other matters, I am going through your interesting paper.  I have  
     not yet finished, and it is not that it is difficult for me; it's just  
     that I always hope to get some quiet time to sit down and concentrate,  
     but between work and sleep, not much time remains.  But I will finish  
     it, hopefully soon.      
     . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  
      
     Yours, 
     Mike
