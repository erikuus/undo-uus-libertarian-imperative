\ni {\bfp Abstract:}~~The prevailing trend of deeming subjective
experiences causally idle obfuscates consciousness research as
epiphenomenal entities cannot be studied. The most flexible way for
conscious experiences to be efficacious is for them to serve as a
basis for free action. Regrettably, no objective evidence testifies
for this possibility. In this paper I shall explain that if we
seek the truth we must for purely logical reasons, irrespective
of theoretical ideas and empirical data about the origin of our
activity, follow the {\itp Libertarian Imperative\/} --- the 
demand to try always to act in accord with the belief that one
exercises the {\itp incompatibilist\/} free volition. The Libertarian
Imperative urges us to try to reject any conception about our nature
--- including the modern scientific picture of human beings --- which
claims that we are entirely law-governed creatures.

\ni Our epistemic situation is agonising. On one hand, scientific
observations strongly suggest that the world is thoroughly physical
--- a huge material system that ultimately consists of relatively
simple fundamental physical entities which obey deterministic or
probabilistic laws of dynamics. On the other hand, we are
subjectively aware of undergoing phenomenal experiences and of being
free originative agents. But phenomenal consciousness and genuine,
incompatibilist free volition have no place in the physicalistic
world picture, and, given the immense theoretical and technical
achievements of modern materialistic sciences, there is a tremendous
psychological pressure to deny their existence. It is no wonder that
the scholarly community has almost entirely succumbed to this
pressure. Fortunately, the darkest years of dominance by radical
materialism are over and the issue of consciousness has begun to
attract the attention it deserves.

\sta
\cl{\bf The Tangled Rehabilitation of Consciousness}
\sat
Although hardly anybody denies the existence of consciousness these
days, many philosophers try to explain it away by redefining it in
purely physicalistic formal-structural terms (see Churchland,
1995; Dennett, 1991; Hardcastle, 1995). However, there is an
insuperable obstacle to these aspirations: the phenomenal qualitative
character or {\it qualia\/} of conscious experiences. The attempts to
treat qualia in the language of orthodox physics are utterly
unconvincing and doomed to failure because qualia --- including the
most general quale {\it experientialness\/} or {\it
something-it-is-like-to-be-ness\/} which is inherent to every
phenomenon of consciousness --- and the formal-structural concepts of
physics --- whether about simple or extremely complicated systems and
processes --- belong to entirely different categories. For that
reason ever more philosophers admit that the phenomenon which has
been traditionally called consciousness and is now often called
phenomenal consciousness does not fit into the strictly physicalistic
world scheme (see, e.g., Searle, 1992; Chalmers, 1995, 1996). They
suppose that phenomenal consciousness is either like some sort of
`field' --- the field of phenomenal experience --- which exists over
and above the physical fields and particles (see Libet, 1994), or it
is the intrinsic qualitative essence of physical entities themselves,
as panpsychists have always suggested (see Griffin, 1997). Both these
positions amount to the abandoning of the belief that the world is
ontologically thoroughly physical in the traditional sense.  

Regrettably, the rehabilitation of consciousness has become tangled
as the majority of scholars who acknowledge the existence of
phenomenal experiences try, nevertheless, to save the most basic
doctrine of the materialist world concept: they hold that the
physically lawful dynamics of the material world is not disturbed by
the nonphysical constituents and properties of reality. By assuming
that the physical domain is causally autonomous, the causal behaviour
of the physical world is theoretically safeguarded from any `marring'
impact from the extraphysical. Moreover, the physical domain is
considered to be not only causally autonomous but also causally
sufficient: it is held that the physical determines not only its own
dynamics but also the entire existence of the nonphysical. Though the
world is allowed to be ontologically heterogeneous, its causal thread
is believed to be homogeneous --- completely physical.

\stb
{\itl The idea of epiphenomenal consciousness}
\sbt
The view that the nonphysical exists but is determined by the
physical implies that consciousness is causally impotent. The thesis
of the epiphenomenality of consciousness is explicitly advocated,
e.g., by Frank Jackson (1982), David Lewis (1995) and David Chalmers
(1995, 1996).

The epiphenomenalist theories of consciousness have been criticised
by several authors (see Beloff, 1994; Elitzur, 1995; Hodgson, 1994,
1996; Lowe, 1995; Warner, 1996), most forcefully by Daniel Dennett
(1991, pp.~398--406). The fatal defect of theories of epiphenomena is
that they cut themselves off from any empirical basis. The fact-based
theories of epiphenomena are impossible for logical reasons.

It is logically possible that our subjective experiences are causally
inert. There is also nothing counterlogical in advancing a {\it theory\/}
that we actually have certain epiphenomenal experiences. It can
even be agreed that everyone of us knows that this theory is correct,
because everyone of us is necessarily aware of one's own experiences
(Lowe, 1996, p.~190). But it is illogical to claim that this kind of
consciousness can serve as an {\it empirical basis\/} for our
theoretical speculations about it, or that we can make reports of
{\it evidential value\/} about the existence and content of such
a consciousness. A defender of epiphenomenal consciousness is
justified to contend, as Chalmers (1996, p.~198) does: 
\bcit
I {\itp know\/} I am conscious, and the knowledge is based solely on my
immediate experience. To say that the knowledge makes no difference
to my psychological functioning is not to say the experience makes no
difference to {\itp me}.
\ecit
\ni But, on pain of self-contradiction, he cannot assure us that
he asserts he knows he is conscious {\it because\/} he knows he is
conscious. He has to concede that according to his own views his
statement has been produced by his psychological (neurophysiological)
functioning no matter whether he in fact {\it knows\/} he is conscious. 

The belief in the autonomy of the physical world spoils the
endeavours to rehabilitate phenomenal consciousness. If a champion of
phenomenal experiences believes in the causal sufficiency of physics,
he must hold that the experiences are causally idle, and in doing so,
he exposes himself to ridicule by his physicalist adversaries and
strips the problem of phenomenal consciousness of any scientific
import. If one argues like Chalmers (1995) that there is the really
hard problem of experiences but that explaining (i) the access to
one's own internal states, (ii) the production of reports about
mental events, and (iii) the deliberate control of behaviour are all
easy problems concerning only the neurophysiological mechanisms and
processes, one falls an easy prey to his physicalist opponents who
use an indefeasible logical argument to force him to admit that (i)
the `really hard problem' is, in fact, merely one of the `easy'
problems, since the reason why the intellectual wrestling with the
`hard problem' arises and leads to definite conclusions can be
explained `easily' as being the result of the neurophysiological
processes alone, and that therefore (ii) the concept of epiphenomenal
experiences presents only as negligible an interest to sciences as a
hypothesis about the physical fields which surround material
particles but exert no impact on anything.  

The proponents of phenomenal consciousness hold overwhelmingly to the
view that the nonphysical is causally idle, and for that reason most
of the modern theories of phenomenal consciousness are demolished by
materialists before they really get off the ground. The philosophy of
consciousness is in a stalemate. 

\sta
\cl{\bf Can There Be a Science of Phenomenal Consciousness?}
\sat
From what has been said above it should be clear that any fact-based
theory of phenomenal consciousness is incompatible with the doctrine
of the causal closure of the physical universe as we know it. {\it
The empirically grounded science of phenomenal consciousness is
possible only if the physical world as conceptualised by modern
materialistic philosophy is causally open.} This proposition must be
regarded as the cornerstone of any logically sound philosophy of
phenomenal consciousness.  

Those who assume that the fact-based science of phenomenal
consciousness is possible are usually not aware that this assumption
requires abandoning the modern scientific world view by denying the
causal completeness of physics. The problem of experiences is far
more serious than is generally realised.

We face the painful dilemma: either the contemporary scientific world
concept is correct and there can be no empirically based theories of
phenomenal consciousness, or there can be such theories but then the
basic nature of the world is utterly misdescribed by modern science.
The decision to forsake the well established and intelligible world
view would be so radical that we cannot afford to be thoughtless
here. It is wise to discard the materialist world picture only if
there are {\it very\/} serious reasons to do so. Are there, then, any
plausible alternatives to the physically determined world?

Experiences can be causally efficacious in two very
different ways. One possibility is that phenomenal experiences are
like some kind of field which is in mutual interaction with the
physical world so that together they form a combined physical-mental
reality with dynamics that obey a definite set of natural laws
(Libet, 1994; Smythies, 1994). Such a composite physical-mental world
is of the same basic kind as the purely material one in the sense
that it is entirely law-governed. The other, much more extravagant,
possibility for phenomenal experiences to be causally effective is
for them to serve as a basis for free-will activity.

The first option --- that the world is a law-governed composite
physical-mental system --- is logically unproblematic, but we do not
have any factual evidence in support of it. Amazingly, there {\it is\/}
sufficient ground for preferring the second option --- the view that
we and other conscious creatures are free agents --- to materialism,
even though the concept of free volition is supernatural, hard to
comprehend, and logically problematic. I shall show in this paper 
that for simple logical reasons we are justified in trying
always to follow the thesis of being free agents.

\stb
{\itl Freedom of will and consciousness studies}
\sbt
The term `freedom of will' is used to denominate two quite
different properties.

Traditionally --- and this is still the commonsense custom ---
the property of the will called its {\it freedom\/} has been
interpreted as the ability to select one actuality from several
possibilities, as the ability, for anything one tries to do,
always to have tried to do otherwise. Free will in this strong,
libertarian sense is incompatible with causal determinism, for
the latter rules out the possibility of a person's trying to do
other than what he does try. 

The other, modern tendency is to designate by `freedom of will' the
creature's property to function autonomously, to be free of {\it
outside\/} coercion and constraint. The freedom thus defined is
compatible with the complete causal necessitation of behaviour. A 
decision is free in this compatibilist sense simply because it is
one's {\it own\/} decision, no matter how rigidly determined by one's
own internal state.

To avoid terminological equivocation, I shall refer to the property
{\it free in the libertarian sense\/} by the term `Free-Will', and to
the property {\it free in the compatibilist sense\/} by the term
`Self-Willed'. 

We are, undoubtedly, quite autonomous Self-Willed beings. But are we
{\it Free\/} agents, and which consequences our admittance of having
Free Will would have for our conduct and undertakings? In particular,
how is the Free Will problem related to consciousness studies? 

We, people of modern scientific education predominantly regard
ourselves as material creatures lacking supernatural Free Volition.
What would be different if we accepted the belief of being Free
agents? Our everyday behaviour would probably not change at all:
maybe we would only feel a bit more responsible for our deeds. 
However, our philosophical apprehension of the general character
of the world and our own basic nature would certainly undergo a
radical change. The belief in Free Will would also have a strong
impact upon one essential field of our scientific endeavours ---
upon consciousness studies in general and investigations of
conscious activities in particular. 

If we hold of being Free agents, we have to discard the
materialist notion of ourselves, so that there would be no
ideological pressure any more to construe at whatever cost the
phenomenal experiences as specific physical brain processes
explaining away the existence of phenomenal qualia, and we can
then analyse the enigmatic qualitative character of the content
of consciousness with due scientific impartiality. 

If we hold that we are Free agents, we must substantially revise
also the methodological basis of the current research into the
brain--consciousness relationship. This research (see Crick, 1994) is
aimed at finding out where the neurons responsible for conscious
awareness are located in the brain, and in what way they are firing.
It is taken for granted (Crick and Koch, 1995) that the causal chain
{\it stimulus-evoked brain processes---phenomenal
experiences---behavioural reaction to phenomenal experiences\/} is 
realised physiologically, by neural networks. It is argued that if a
group of neurons does not project to the brain's motor areas
responsible for our reporting on what we experience then the
activities of these neurons do not contribute to conscious
experiences directly. But if we accept the view that the impact of
phenomenal experiences upon the creature's overt behaviour is
mediated by his Free Will, we must admit that a distinctive feature
of consciousness-evoking brain processes is that normally they do not
cause our behaviour via neural (purely physical) mechanisms. This 
implication sharply contradicts the basic assumptions of current,
materialistically motivated consciousness and brain research 
programs.

If we hold of being Free agents, we have to acknowledge that the
most fundamentally important of all presently conceivable scientific
inquiries is elucidating which brain events the Free-Will efforts
evoke: how the Will modifies the activity of neuronal networks in
defiance of natural causes.  

Hence, the Free Will problem is of utmost scientific import and is
most intimately related to questions about the ontological status and
causal efficacy of phenomenal consciousness. I think this truth
should be always stressed when discussing the Free Will issue, for
there is a widespread sentiment to view the Free Will controversy as
an esoteric metaphysical puzzle of academic interest for only a small
group of philosophers. That is why I decided to add to the exposition
of the title thesis this lengthy introduction, and preferred to
submit the present article to the Journal of Consciousness Studies
rather than to some `purely' philosophical journal. 

\sta
\cl{\bf The Problem of Free Will}
\sat
In the Middle Ages European intellectual life was subordinated
to religious ideology which concentrated upon the Free-Will
aspects of existence and denied the importance of studying
lawful regularities present in the world. With the rise of
modern science when more and more laws holding in nature were
discovered, and partly as an overreaction to religious
dogmatism, the `scientific' dogma of nomism --- the view that
the dynamics of the world are {\it thoroughly\/} law-governed --- 
began to gain popularity. Already many scholars of the early modern
scientific era, among them Spinoza, Hobbes, Leibniz and Kant,
accepted this view, and in recent times the doctrine of the universal
ruling of natural causality has won support by overwhelming majority
of scientists. This has led to the denial of the Freedom of Will. Let
us mention, for example, Albert Einstein's firm antilibertarian
convictions. In modern times only very few scientists have dared to
defend the explicitly libertarian views. True, among those few have
been such world-famous scholars as Sir Arthur Eddington, Sir Charles
Sherrington and Sir John Eccles.  

Some scientists, finding it implausible to deny our being Free agents
responsible for our conduct, but believing at the same time that the
dynamics of the physical world are entirely regular, have suggested
that even a truly Free-Will activity may be compatible with the
universality of lawful dynamics.  

One of ideas aimed at justifying this suggestion has been proposed by
Erwin Schr\"odinger (1977). He sought to avoid a contradiction
between the (allegedly) universal obtaining of the laws of nature and
incontrovertible direct experience that one oneself commands one's
motions, feeling full responsibility for them, by assuming that every
conscious mind controls the motion of the atoms according to the laws
of nature. However, if this thesis were true, then whatever claims
that we are aware of nonphysical aspects of our existence --- 
including the claim that we, following our Free decision, direct the
motion of the atoms according to the laws of nature --- would be of
no evidential import, because everything that we as material beings
would in this case do would have been done by us in exactly the same
way also if we were purely physical deterministically functioning
creatures lacking phenomenal consciousness and Free Will. Our
producing assertions that we are introspectively aware of possessing
Free Will could be explained then as a result of {\it lawful\/}
functioning of our material bodies regardless of whether this lawful
functioning is deterministic or Freely evoked. 

The other idea about how Free Will can be compatible with universally
lawful dynamics is more sophisticated. It is argued (see, e.g.,
Hodgson, 1991, 1994, 1996) that the Will can exercise its
Freedom by selecting between alternatives which quantum indeterminacy
leaves open, preserving at the same time the physically lawful
statistics of sets of quantum events, so that, when described from a
physical perspective alone, Free Will looks like chance. However, in
this case a Free agent cannot command its behaviour Freely according
to its best discretion, but must merely play a role of a generator of
random events. The issuing of claims that one knows of having Free
Will would then be explainable as resulting from a combination of
one's lawful and blindly random functioning, irrespective of whether
such functioning is caused by the physical determinism and
randomness, or by one's Free Volition. If the Will directed quantum
chance in its own aims, the lawful statistics of quantum events would
be violated --- if not the low-order, then certainly the higher-order
probability distribution functions: the correlations of outcomes of
individual quantum events with the brain's global state as it is
represented in the content of consciousness evoked by the brain. 

The Free-Will behaviour I have in view when formulating a libertarian
imperative is the {\it truly\/} Free-Will behaviour which is not
compatible with any kind of physically lawful functioning of our
bodies (brains). Our having of such Free Will is resolutely denied
by modern science. 

\sta
\cl{\bf The Formulation of the Libertarian Imperative}
\sat
Two aspects of the Free Will problem are discussed intensively by
philosophers: the conceptual aspect --- what Free Will {\it means\/}
and whether it is compatible with determinism --- and the epistemic
aspect --- how we can get to {\it know\/} the truth about the
presence of Free Will in the world. But a third important aspect of
this problem is almost entirely neglected: the praxeological aspect
--- according to which belief about possessing Free Will one should
{\it behave}. I will give an answer to this practical question by
formulating and substantiating a principle of behaviour which I call
the Libertarian Imperative. The Imperative is a normative requirement
that is reasonable or unreasonable relative to general aims of
behaviour. In formulating the Libertarian Imperative I assume that
the supreme principle of the person's conduct is absolute honesty so
that any intentional lying, even by noble motives, is excluded. 

By definition, the Libertarian Imperative is the requirement:

\vskip5pt
\cl{\it One must always try to act in accord with the}

\cl{\it thesis that one has the libertarian Free Will.} 
\vskip5pt

\ni I am not entirely content with the given wording of the
Imperative. Although I assure that by Freedom of Will I mean the
{\it incompatibilist\/} variety of freedom, I am nevertheless
afraid of claims that any kind of Free Will may be compatible
with universal determinism and that therefore the Imperative
need not work against the doctrine of nomism. I will therefore
rephrase the Libertarian Imperative so that it would be firmly
safeguarded against such misconstruings. 

In principle, the Free-Will activity may be strictly regular, but it
is natural to think that a Free agent will hardly give up the
possibility to act Freely rather than, without exception,
according to certain rigorous universal rules. Hence, we can
regard the Free-Will activity as a non-nomic activity, i.e.~an
activity that is not universally lawful, and reformulate the
Libertarian Imperative as follows: 

\vskip5pt
\cl{\it One must always try to act in accord with the}

\cl{\it thesis that one is not a law-governed creature.} 
\vskip5pt

\ni The Imperative expressed in this form is narrower by its content
than it is in its original formulation for it does not cover the
case of universally regular Free-Will activity, and is, in the
first place, not a requirement to defend the Free Will thesis,
but {\it a call for attacking the nomist assumption\/} --- the
view that all processes in the world, including brain events,
obey at some basic level certain rigorous deterministic or
probabilistic laws of dynamics. It would be even better to call
the Libertarian Imperative so formulated an Anti-Nomic Imperative.
It is just this Anti-Nomic Imperative that I have in view when I
speak about the Libertarian Imperative below.  

\sta
\cl{\bf The Justification of the Libertarian Imperative}
\sat
In order to understand the explanation why the Libertarian Imperative
must be observed one has to master only two simple concepts: one of
the basic concepts used by science --- the meaning of `lawful
dynamics' --- and one of the basic commonsense concepts --- the
meaning of `to try' in everyday practical sense. 

\stb
{\itl The concept of lawful dynamics}
\sbt
What is lawful dynamics is easy to understand in general, but the
variety of it that has most to do with the
determinism--libertarianism issue --- the deterministic choice-making
between alternatives --- is occasioning much confusion. It is argued
that determinism does not preclude the making of choices, but it is
often not realised that the deterministic choice is fundamentally
different from the Free-Will choice. The Free-Will choice is free in
the sense that one could have selected a distinct alternative from
that which one actually selected. Quite otherwise, the deterministic
`choice' is not a choice between genuine alternatives. But many
philosophers are muddling the issue by trying to produce an
impression as if there were no essential difference between
deterministic and Free-Will choice.

Various tactics are used for selling deterministic choice for a
genuine one. Some argue that deterministic decision-making is not
blind obeying of the rules, because the latter evolve in the course of
the system's functioning. Others claim (see Ho, 1996) that organisms
free themselves from the laws of physics by being coherent wholes
whose parts participate in the coordinated action. But however
`dynamic' or `holistic' a {\it deterministic\/} process may be, at the
basic level it is always determined by blind following of fundamental
rules --- the laws of nature. 

A vigorous effort to argue for compatibilism is made by Dennett
(1984). His tactics are ingenious. Not believing in libertarian
free will, he finds it reasonable to redefine the meanings of words
and expressions traditionally used for discussing the free will
problem --- unavoidable, inevitable, possibility, necessity, open
future, can, could have done otherwise, deliberation, free choice,
free will, etc.~--- by assigning them `useful' content applicable
only in the realm of lawful dynamics. Then a talk about our allegedly
nomic functioning sounds as a good old talk about Free-Will behaviour
and is likely to provoke no protest by unsophisticated common sense.
And more importantly, further arguing about Free Will is rendered
impossible because you now lack any words for relevant concepts ---
your tongue is amputated. However, Dennett's exertions to please
common sense while staying faithful to physicalism end, at a closer
look, in fiasco. Admitting that we rightly dread such confining
circumstances where our options are reduced to one, he offers us two
varieties of open future: the epistemic one (being nescient of what
will happen) and the probabilistic one (being dynamically partly
stochastic). To be free is to be ignorant or at the mercy of blind
chance --- that is how we can have free will and science too, in
Dennett's opinion.  

If one's behaviour is deterministic, then at {\it every\/} moment one
has only {\it one\/} option of acting, for this is what determinism
means. The outcome of one's deterministic deliberation is fixed both
in its process and its ultimate product, and thus one cannot prevent
its occurrence. This truth is particularly clearly explained by Peter
van Inwagen (1983).

If one's behaviour is partly probabilistic, then one
produces also purely random acts. In principle, one can, without
violating the probabilistic law of dynamics, behave in very many
different ways, provided, however, that the actual behavioural
pattern produced would have a blind-chance character satisfying this
law. 

Consequently, if one's decision-making and other behavioural acts are
law-gov\-erned, one cannot prevent their regular or purely random
occurrence. 

\stb
{\itl The commonsense meaning of trying}
\sbt
To understand what `to try' means in an everyday pretheoretic
sense is to understand what one must do to obey such orders as:
Try to raise your hand; Try to utter `Physicalism is
fallacious'; Try to imagine a circle; etc. This presupposes
possessing practical abilities to evoke various volitional
efforts. This does {\it not\/} presuppose having any knowledge
about the brain processes (or soul processes if such exist)
involved in voluntary acts of trying. 

\stb
{\itl The peculiarity of justification of the Libertarian Imperative}
\sbt
The scheme of argumentation I will apply in justifying the
Libertarian Imperative doesn't belong amongst standard methods
of scientific ratiocination. Therefore many scholars may
overlook the argument altogether, and others may wonder why the 
pragmatic and narrowly logical mode of reasoning is used instead
of approaching the problem from a natural science perspective.
It is necessary to explain in what sense the scheme of reasoning
applied is peculiar. Due to its distinctive character this mode
of arguing enables one to arrive at conclusions not attainable
by traditional scientific methods. 

The natural scientific approach to the world is, in principle,
quite simple. By means of observations a set of empirical data
is obtained about the structure of some segment of reality. The
task is to describe this structure in a perspicuous way and to
discover all kinds of regularities and irregularities present
either in this structure itself, or in the structure of that
part of reality which is supposedly the cause of, or underlies,
the empirically established structure. The natural scientific
treatment of the Free Will problem would consist in
investigating the spatiotemporal structure of brain processes,
and in elucidating whether it obeys the laws of physical
dynamics at atomic level. 

A characteristic feature of the natural scientific method is its
applicability from the third-person point of view. If I want my
own brain processes studied, it is scientifically preferable
to let that be done by other persons --- by a team of skilled
neuroscientists --- than by myself. 

It may seem that any scientific justification of the conformity
of our behaviour with the thesis of our having Free Will must be
based on results of natural scientific research into brain
dynamics. Such opinion is rooted in a plausible-looking
assumption that it is sensible to try to act in accord with the
thesis {\it A\/} only if we have first established, or have at
least some ground to suppose, that {\it A\/} is true. It seems
unbelievable that there can be a class of situations when it is
unconditionally reasonable to act on the basis of the thesis
{\it A}, while having no reason for holding that {\it A\/}
rather than {\it not-A\/} is true. But there are such
situations. Here is a simple example.  

Suppose an expedition has been sent to an alien planet with a task to
explore its ionosphere. By accident, all measuring equipment gets
crushed in landing. However, in spite of having learned absolutely
nothing about the physical characteristics of the planet's
ionosphere, the research team is, nevertheless, justified to try to 
forward to the Earth the reports of the following type about these
characteristics: `The planet's ionosphere transmits radio waves of
the frequency used in sending this message'. The issuing of such
messages is justified because they don't reach the addressee if
false. The attempts to send such messages can make things in the
world only better (if the messages are true) in the sense of how much
true knowledge its inhabitants possess, but not worse (if the
messages are false). 

The reason why in specific cases it is unquestionably sound to perform
certain acts in accordance with a premise of which we don't know if
it is right or wrong, is purely logical: if the actual states of
affairs are in these cases such that our premise is wrong, these same
states of affairs prevent our acts from being efficacious. In
such a case a proposition can be accepted as a basis for sensible
behaviour solely because of the situation's specific logical
structure {\it regardless of any knowledge as to whether this 
proposition is true or false}. This logical structure is
rendered peculiar by a self-referentiality present in it.

That kind of justification of behaviour is narrowly logical
rather than {\it natural\/} scientific, but as far as it is
based on sound logic, and logic is deemed a scientific
discipline, it is definitely a specific variety of {\it
scientific} justification. The ideal limit of the cases where
such kind of substantiation of behaviour is possible is the 
unique situation of being faced with the problem of {\it one's
own\/} Freedom of the Will. In this case the peculiarity of the
logical structure of the situation --- the presence of
self-referentiality in it --- is warranted by the fact that one
has to reason about the character of this reasoning itself. The
relevant reasoning can be performed only from the first-person
point of view --- it can be used for justifying only one's own
behaviour --- and so it contrasts sharply with standard
scientific argumenting which can always be applied from the
third-person perspective.

{\itl Why the Libertarian Imperative should be obeyed}
\sbt
The reason why we should always try to act as if we knew that we are
Free agents even if we actually don't know this, is rather simple. 
I think most people are aware of that reason subconsciously. Such
awareness is implicitly evident in claims like: `Any discussion is
meaningless if there are no freely willing agents', `Be kind to the
determinists for they have had no choice about what they think and
write', etc. I shall explicate this reason as clearly as I can.  

Any of our volitional efforts is either a nomic process obeying
at some fundamental level definite deterministic or
probabilistic laws of dynamics, or it is a non-nomic, Free act
exempt at any fundamental level of description from the laws of
nature. 

If our volitional activity is, and has always been, nomic, then:
(i)~if we maintain that our activity is nomic, we are right; and
(ii)~if we maintain that our activity is not nomic, we are
wrong, {\it but we are wrong unavoidably}, because we cannot
then prevent the regular or purely random law-governed
occurrence of our mental and behavioural acts. If the laws of
dynamics are strictly deterministic, any other course of our
behaviour could not, out of {\it nomic necessity}, have taken
place. And if the laws of dynamics are, at least partly,
fundamentally probabilistic, various courses of our behaviour
might have realised, but then only by pure chance over which
nothing and nobody can have control in order to avoid any
particular way of behaviour. 

If our volitional activity is not nomic, then: (i)~if we
maintain that our activity is not nomic, we are right; and
(ii)~if we maintain that our activity is nomic, we are wrong,
{\it yet we are wrong not unavoidably}, because as Free agents
we could have behaved otherwise, i.e.~could have maintained that
our volitional activity is not nomic.  

Consequently, in order to behave in the most reasonable way
possible (provided we seek the truth) in respect to the Free
Will problem, we must attempt to act always in conformity with
the thesis that our functioning is not law-governed, for if our
activity is, in fact, not nomic, our such attempts cohere with
the truth, and if we actually are law-governed beings, whatever
attempts by us are not the kind of acts that can make things in
the world either better or worse than they would otherwise be,
because then these attempts themselves belong to nature's causal
network and their lawful occurrence, either deterministic or
random, cannot be avoided. It is reasonable to try to behave as
a libertarian by maintaining that our functioning is at no level
of description strictly lawful.

\sta
\cl{\bf The Specific Features of the Libertarian Imperative}
\sat
The justification of the Libertarian Imperative is easily
understandable because what is justified in the first place is not
one's attempt to claim that one's behaviour is Free-Volitional, but
one's trying to deny that one's behaviour is lawful (unavoidable),
and the concept of lawful dynamics is much more easily comprehensible
than that of Free-Will activity. The simplicity of justification of
the Imperative may even create an impression that it is a cheap
sophistry.  

The Libertarian Imperative is not an epistemic statement: it
doesn't assert that one {\it knows\/} that his activity is not
law-governed. However, for the reason that the Imperative
requires one to try to behave on the basis of the thesis that he
possesses Free Will, obeying the Imperative is by its
consequences to one's activity equivalent to the acceptance by
him of the belief that he {\it knows\/} he has Free Will.  

The Libertarian Imperative is ontologically general in the sense that
it requires the attempting to deny not only the {\it physical\/}
(materialistic) universal determinateness of one's behaviour, but
also {\it any other kind\/} of such determinateness, be it purely
spiritual, or forced by some kind of divine power, or whatever. 

From the logical form of the justification scheme of the
Libertarian Imperative it is evident that it can be applied
extremely restrictedly --- only for justifying those of one's
own occurrent volitional efforts which are aimed at presenting
or investigating {\it these same efforts\/} as the exemplars of
non-nomic events. The logical basis of the Imperative does {\it
not\/} justify my trying to regard my other volitional acts, let
alone the behaviour of other individuals, as non-nomic. Any
suggestions about the wider domain of the Free-Will behaviour
can only be scientific-hypothetically motivated.

\sta
\cl{\bf The Libertarian Imperative,}

\cl{\bf William James's Will to Believe, and Pascal's Wager}
\sat
My justification of the Libertarian Imperative may seem to have
much in common with William James's stance toward free will as
presented in his essay ``The Will to Believe'' (James, 1979,
pp.~13--33). In fact, there is not much similarity between my
and James's positions.

Strictly speaking, my position is identical to that of James's
only in the following sense: we both hold that there are
propositions which cannot be ignored for the reason that we
don't have any grounds whatsoever for judging whether they are
true or false. James argues for the right of turning certain
specific propositions of this kind into beliefs. I claim that it
is reasonable to try to act as if some of these propositions
were true. There is a difference between (i) accepting a
proposition as a belief and (ii) acting as if the proposition
were true without believing it to be true. I admit that this
difference is a rather subtle one, therefore I will not object
much if one says that I argue like James for justifiability of
accepting belief in certain propositions the truth value of
which is not known. But with this the similarities between
James's and my positions end.  

There are two substantial differences between James's and my 
arguments. 

(1) James claims that our passional nature is a lawful
determinant of our choice if there is a genuine option that
cannot by its nature be decided on intellectual grounds; that we
have the right to believe at our own risk any hypothesis that is
live enough to tempt our will. I, on the contrary, do not appeal
to our `non-intellectual nature' but to our `purely judging
mind', to our `dispassionately judicial intellect with no pet
hypothesis'. True, as James has emphasised, one has to admit the
first steps necessarily on emotional grounds: `Science herself
consults her heart when she lays it down that the infinite
ascertainment of fact and correction of false belief are the
supreme goods for man'. However, from this onwards I take `no
farther passional step' but rely exclusively upon our merely
logical intellect, upon our pure rationality, by presenting a
sensible proof, a coercive demonstrative argument. I show that
the problem I address is {\it intellectually\/} decidable,
without any need to let our {\it passional nature\/} decide the
answer. The James's sort of argument justifies belief in Free
Will on {\it pragmatic/psychological\/} grounds, while my
defence of the Libertarian Imperative is purely {\it logical}.  

(2) The realm of problems to which James's approach is
applicable is rather wide, whereas my way of argumentation can
be applied {\it extremely\/} restrictedly: for justifying only
{\it very\/} specific beliefs (roughly speaking). For
justifying the other beliefs which are justifiable in James's
sense, my method does not work at all. This is because my way of
reasoning derives its logical power from the fact that it
selects as the proposition {\it A\/} in the task `Please justify
a voluntary acceptance of belief in proposition {\it A\/}' the
precondition of this task itself: `you have a power of voluntary
decision-making'. 

Since my way of argumentation addresses a judging mind, it is
also apt to compare it with Pascal's Wager type of reasoning
which likewise appeals to intellect.

Pascal advised us to believe in God, for if we did and God
indeed exists, we would gain eternal beatitude, while we risk
only a finite loss if God does not exist, and a possible finite
loss is reasonable, if there is but the probability of infinite
gain. 

The arguments of Pascal's Wager type are entirely sensible.
Particularly, Pascal's Wager type argument in defence of Free 
Will is quite powerful. Free Will is so important phenomenon
that even if one has not yet any convincing evidence for its
existence, it is unreasonable to ignore the possibility that
Free Will may, after all, exist in the world, and to declare the
Free Will issue solved and closed.

My defence of the Libertarian Imperative is not, however, of
Pascal's Wager type. My logic of reasoning may seem to be
closely related to the logic of Pascal's Wager because I stress
a truism that the Free Will issue is not an unimportant minor
problem that doesn't deserve serious attention. But here the
resemblance ends.  

There are two essential differences between my argumentation and
Pascal's Wager type of reasoning.  

(1) Pascal's Wager type of reasoning consists in weighing gains
and losses of alternative decisions, and its conclusions depend
on how large or small are those gains and losses, and how
reliable is our assessment of them. Such reasoning is of 
game-theoretical type. My argumentation is not of
game-theoretical type. Its conclusion doesn't depend at all on
how large or small are gains and losses of alternative
decisions, or whether there are any gains and losses at all.

(2) Pascal's Wager type of reasoning can be applied for making
decisions about a very wide class of alternatives: we use this
kind of reasoning quite often in our everyday life. My scheme of
argumentation can be applied extremely restrictedly: only in the
case of one very particular kind of problems. The problem about
one's own Free Will is one of them due to its unique logical
structure. One is not asked to choose whether he believes or not
that God exists, or that people have immaterial souls, or that
there is afterlife, etc., but one is asked to {\it choose\/}
whether he believes or not that he is {\it able to choose}. Just
owing to this self-referentiality present in the task it is
possible to solve it by purely logical means. 

\sta
\cl{\bf Complementarity of Logical and Natural Scientific}

\cl{\bf Approaches to the Free Will Problem}
\sat
The narrowly logical approach to the Free Will problem cannot
replace the natural scientific research into the general
character of living beings' functioning. The logical reasoning,
unlike empirical investigations, cannot give us any {\it
knowledge\/} about whether our functioning, or that of other
creatures, is lawful. This truth is very easy to understand. 

It is not so easy to see, however, that natural scientific
studies of our activity cannot, in turn, replace the narrowly
logical approach to it.

Let us consider first the case when our activity is non-nomic at
any level of description. Can we ascertain this fact by means of
empirical inquiries? Obviously not. Suppose it has been
established that at the most basic level accessible to 
investigations at a given time our functioning is not entirely
nomic. This gives us, however, no guarantee that at some deeper
level of description our dynamics may not be fully lawful. By
way of natural scientific explorations it is in principle
impossible to find out that our activity is {\it not\/}
law-governed. If we remain satisfied with natural scientific
reasoning only, we will never have a firm justification for
behaving in accordance with the view that our activity is not
nomic. The logical approach to the problem does give us such
a basis. 

But how would the matters stand if the empirical research showed
our functioning to be fully lawful? It may seem that in this
case the logical reasoning applied in justifying the Libertarian
Imperative recommends to act contrary to what scientific
knowledge implies, and is, therefore, not complementary to
natural scientific reasoning but plainly defective. However,
this is not the case. Let me remind that the logical argument
doesn't justify regarding acts already accomplished by oneself
as non-nomic; it justifies only one's trying to maintain that
this same trying, and its results if it succeeded, are not
nomically determined. Since an act of trying one is going to
evoke is not an accomplished event about which there can be
scientific knowledge, the acceptance of conclusions of the
logical argument can bring one into conflict not with
empirically established facts, but at worst only with a 
hypothetical suggestion that one's activity which has been
law-governed in the past would remain law-governed also in the
future. 

The thesis `It is always reasonable to try to behave as a
libertarian' should not be interpreted as follows: Of all {\it
logically\/} possible states in which a person of a given kind
might be, it is epistemically more advantageous for him to be in
a state of trying to behave, or behaving, according to the
belief of having Free Will. It is undoubtedly epistemically
disadvantageous to be a libertarian when one's functioning is
deterministic in fact. The libertarian thesis should be
understood as follows: {\it Given that one is the way one
actually is}, if one behaves or will try to behave as a
libertarian, one's such activity is epistemically the most
advantageous of all {\it actually\/} possible --- that is: both
{\it logically\/} and {\it nomically\/} possible --- ways of
behaviour even when one's functioning is in fact deterministic,
because in the latter case there simply are no actually possible
alternatives to one's factual behaviour.

The praxeological approach, complementary to the natural
scientific one, to the problem of one's own Freedom of Will is
possible for the reason that we can exercise our Freedom of
Choice, if we have it, even while ignorant of whether we have it.  
Such an approach --- trying to obey the Libertarian Imperative
--- is, in essence, an {\it experimental\/} settling of the Free
Will controversy. The Imperative can be viewed as the following 
call: let us not speculate whether Free Will is theoretically
possible; let us also not ask whether we have any empirical
evidence in support of or against our possessing of Free Will;
let us take, instead, a straightforwardly experimental approach
to this problem --- let us try to behave as is appropriate to
Free agents and see if we succeed in it. Such experimenting is
subject to a reliable protection mechanism: if it is foredoomed
to failure, it spoils nothing because it can't be then executed
at all. If our behaviour is law-governed, we cannot experiment
with it because we cannot then act otherwise than we are forced
to act according to these laws. 

\sta
\cl{\bf On the Metaphysical Possibility of Free Will}
\sat
Although the possibility of Free Will is not a precondition for
justifying the Libertarian Imperative (as I explained above, obeying
the Imperative is reasonable even in the strictly deterministic
world), it is, nevertheless, appropriate to wonder whether Freedom of
Will is at all conceivable. This question is a pressing one because
of the aforementioned plausible-looking logical (metaphysical)
argument against the possibility of Free Will. It is contended that
Freedom is not possible in any kind of possible world because our
actions which are not necessitated by prior states of the world have
no cause and are thus fortuitous, and a fortuitous event is no kind
of Free choice. The libertarian view that a choice is Free only if it
is not causally determined by preceding events is regarded as obscure
and obscurantic, if not incoherent. 

I shall combat the metaphysical argument against Free Will from two
angles. First, I stress that the impossibility of devising an easily
understandable definition or explanation of what Free Will is is not
decisive evidence that the concept of Free Will is incoherent.
There are universally accepted concepts that are, likewise, not
explicable in a simple way. Secondly, I show that the concept of
natural causation, even if applied to the most simple cases of the
physically deterministic causation processes, is rather
controversial, and that a relevant analysis reveals that the concept
of natural causation is closely reminiscent of the concept of
agent-causation used to explain the meaning of Free-Will activity.  

\stb
{\itl Irreducibility of the concept of Free Will}
\sbt
Some aspects of reality and concepts of these aspects are simple and
easy to understand. Identity, difference, natural numbers,
linear sequence, flat space, regular order, randomness, and the like
are relatively simple, low-grade concepts. However, there are also
higher-grade concepts such as infinity, time, consciousness,
Free-Will activity, omnipotence. It is impossible to downgrade the
high-grade concepts to the level of low-grade ones. This
impossibility must not be regarded as a mark of incoherence of
high-grade concepts. I shall give an example. 

It is easy to understand what `to be actually the case' means. The
concept of {\it actual existence\/} is easily comprehended. But if we
try to explain what time is, we have to use, in addition, the concept
of {\it past existence}. Now, everything that belongs to the past
does not exist actually, in the same sense as what belongs to the
present does. Neither is the past a mere fabrication of fantasy. Some
philosophers insist that there can be no third possibility between 
actual existence and nonexistence, and therefore time cannot have the
property commonly regarded as intrinsic to it: that only the present
exists actually, while the past does not exist {\it any more\/} and the
future does not exist {\it yet}. They argue that time is like space,
all its moments/points --- those of past, present and future ---
existing actually, `at once', in exactly the same way. However, there
is no reason to think that from the irreducibility of high-grade
concepts of past and future existence to the level of lower-grade
concepts of actual existence and nonexistence it follows that the
traditional intuitively well-comprehensible concept of time is
incoherent and therefore only the continua of spatial type can exist. 

Likewise, there is no reason to think that from the irreducibility
of the high-grade concept of Free-Will behaviour to the level of
lower-grade concepts of lawful and stochastic dynamics it follows
that the intuitively well-comprehensible commonsense concept of Free
Will is incoherent. It is illegitimate to maintain that all basic
aspects of reality {\it must\/} be categorially trivial. Longing for
a categorially simple world must not blind us to the extent that we
deny our most subtle intellectual capacities --- our abilities to
comprehend the content of high-grade concepts. 

\stb
{\itl The nontrivial character of the concept of natural causation}
\sbt
Those who argue that the concept of Free-Will behaviour is incoherent
because the only intelligible varieties of behaviour are allegedly
the deterministic and random ones, think that the concept of causally
deterministic dynamics is simple. They have hardly ever been
interested in what causality really means and how it is
metaphysically possible.  

The objective, natural sciences explore only the spatiotemporal
formal structure of the world: its abstract form and not its content 
(see Russell, 1927, p.~163; Carnap, 1969, pp.~19, 28, 107). The task
of sciences is to discover the laws of nature --- the universal
structural regularities present in the world --- whereas the problem
of whether these laws are sustained, e.g., by the divine will or by
the essence of the material substance, is not the business of science
but of metaphysics. Given that the laws of nature as they are do hold
firmly, the knowledge of how they are sustained has no pragmatic
significance whatsoever. To extinguish the metaphysical curiosity, it
is suggested to rely upon the principle of parsimony by looking first
for the simplest reasons, and to accept therefore the belief that the
world's order, including the causal one, is guaranteed by the
material substance itself. As the fundamental laws of physics are
relatively simple, people consider this belief to be reasonable, yet
they never wonder seriously how the causal process might work. Let us
ask this question then.  

The causal sequence of the simplest type can be conceived as follows.
There is some state of affairs S1 at the moment t1. Because of
causality, S1 gives rise to the state S2 an instant later, at the 
moment t2. How can this happen? Will S1 cease to exist at t1 and S2
arise from nothing at t2, so that cause and effect would be
temporally separated?  Hardly so. Rather, it is reasonable to assume
that the causal process is continuous: the state S1 {\it changes\/}
into the state S2. Admitting that the change is something more than
the mere possession of a sequence of different properties at
different times, i.e.~that the pace of change of a state is itself a
definite characteristic of that state, we reach the following
conclusion. While the transformation of the state from S1
to S2 is determined purely logically by the state's pace of change,
the causality in its substantial sense concerning the physical causal
`activity' of the material substance itself is effective in
determining one aspect of the state --- its pace of change --- by
other aspects of that state {\it at the very same moment}. All
fundamental equations of physical dynamics express just this
dependence, both sides of the equations referring to the physical 
situation at one and the same moment. {\it The substantial causal
process consists not in the determination of the present by the past,
but in the self-determination of the present independently of
preceding conditions.} Sounds like the `obscure and panicky'
metaphysics of libertarianism? If one contends that the libertarian
notion of an originative agent capable of contributing something
independently of antecedent causes and conditions is obscure to a
discomforting degree, if not positively mysterious, one has to
concede that then the ordinary concept of causation should also be
regarded as `obscure'. It is useful to bear in mind that the most
traditional concept of causation is not trivial, and is reminiscent
of the libertarian concept of agent-causation according to which the
Free agents self-determine their own character partly independently
of their antecedent properties, being the prime movers or first
causes of their own actions. The libertarian Free activity is not so
disparate from the natural causal process as it seems to be at the
first glance. Causation may well be compatible not only with the
deterministic choice but also with the Free-Will choice. 

\sta
\cl{\bf The Peirastic Rejection of Materialism}
\sat
There are various empirically grounded arguments which question the
validity of materialism (see, e.g., Lowe, 1996; Uus, 1994). The
argumentation used in justifying the Libertarian Imperative gives us,
in addition, a firm {\it logical\/} basis for challenging
materialistic ideology.  

The Libertarian Imperative requires us to try to reject any
philosophy about our nature which claims that we are entirely
lawfully functioning creatures. This means that we must also try to
regard materialism as fallacious. Such abandoning of materialism, if
we succeed in it, would not be epistemic: the Imperative is not based 
on {\it knowledge\/} that our behaviour is not law-governed. Rather,
such discarding of materialism may be called {\it peirastic\/} (from
the Greek word {\it peirastikos}: involving, or performing, an
attempt) because it is based on our ability, if we have it, to {\it
try} to act and act in this way, and is logically justified for the
reason that if this our ability is guaranteed by our Free Volition,
we would be right in dismissing materialism, and if our abandoning of
materialism has taken place in the course of our physically lawful
functioning, then we were forced to act just this way in order not to
spoil the materialistically lawful character of the world's dynamics.

The Libertarian Imperative urges us to discard the materialistic
world view together with its dogmatic impact upon our scientific
research programs. In particular, the Imperative urges us to try 
to reject the thesis that brains are just very complicated physical
organs whose dynamics obey the laws of physics, and accept, instead,
the view that the impact of phenomenal experiences upon the
creature's overt behaviour is mediated by his Free Will.

We have nothing to lose but we may gain immensely if we dare to try
to discard materialism and profess libertarianism.
