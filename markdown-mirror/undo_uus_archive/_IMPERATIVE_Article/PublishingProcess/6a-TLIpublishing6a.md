Dear Keith: 
I posted today a copy of the last version of my paper on Free Will 
for Prof. Libet, and four copies (one regularly spaced and three 
double-spaced) for you. In revising the article I responded/reacted 
to virtually every point in the report (which I add to this message) 
on my paper by the anonymous referee.

Dear Keith: 
 
I considered your proposal to write a review of Lowe's book 
"Subjects of Experience" for JCS, and I think I would like 
to try to do it. The reasonable length of the review would 
probably be 1.5 JCS pages -- the average length of JCS book 
reviews. I have a copy of Lowe's book. 
 
Have you received the final version of my article on Free Will?

That sounds about right.  Can you email it to Anthony when it's ready. 
 
>Have you received the final version of my article on Free Will? 
 
Yes thanks very much.  I'm saving reading it until we get to the proof 
stage (assuming it passes the final hurdles). 
 
best wishes

Libet has just given the go-ahead for your revised paper (in fact he was 
quite enthusiastic, which is unusual, as he can't stand philosophers!)  
 
So now we'll send it to the ed-in-chief, Joe Goguen -- should be OK, but 
he's a little bit unpredictable.  The issue as a whole is shaping up  
very nicely and I'm looking forward to publishing it greatly. 
 
All the best.

Subject: JCS Paper 
 
Dear Undo, 
 
At long last I am getting ready to typeset the papers for the "Volition" 
issue of JCS to be published next year. 
 
I have a paper copy of your final version, but it would save me a great 
deal of time if you could send me an electronic version, either by email 
or as a disk through the post. 
 
Thanking you in advance, 
 
Anthony Freeman.

Dear Anthony: 
 
With this email letter I send you the text of my JCS paper "The  
Libertarian Imperative" complete with plain-TEX paraphernalia. 
In a separate email letter I will send you today also the pure 
text of the paper with these paraphernalia removed.
