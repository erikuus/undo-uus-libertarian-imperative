# The Libertarian Imperative Archive

This repository is an archival edition of Undo Uus's philosophical project **The Libertarian Imperative**: its core argument, manuscript evolution, editorial process, publication pathway, and post-publication reception.

## What The Libertarian Imperative Is

At its core, the argument is a practical imperative about how one should act under uncertainty about free will:

1. If libertarian free will is true, acting as free is correct.
2. If libertarian free will is false and behavior is law-governed, acting as free was unavoidable anyway.
3. Therefore one should try to act in accord with incompatibilist free volition (the Libertarian Imperative).

This moves the debate from only metaphysical speculation toward a methodological stance for lived action and inquiry.

### Key Terms (Plain-Language)

- **Libertarian free will / incompatibilism**: the thesis that at least some human actions are *not* fully fixed by prior states and laws (not merely “freedom from external coercion”).
- **Acting as free**: treating one’s deliberation and commitments as *genuinely up to oneself* (a stance for inquiry and conduct), not claiming to possess metaphysical certainty about how the world is.

## Why It Is Original And Time-Relevant

- It reframes free will as a normative imperative, not only a descriptive thesis.
- It links consciousness studies and agency: if consciousness is causally meaningful, free action is a central test case.
- It remains relevant across eras because it addresses a stable problem: how to orient action when first-person agency and third-person science appear in tension.

## Archival Principles Used

- **Originals preserved as-is** in `undo-uus-archive/_IMPERATIVE_Article/*` and `undo-uus-archive/_IMPERATIVE_Responses/*`.
- **Readability-first markdown mirrors** are generated under `markdown-mirror/*`.
- **Twofold principle**: originals are authoritative; markdown prioritizes clean machine/human readability while preserving content.
- **Traceability**: each markdown copy records source path and SHA256 checksum.
- **Reproducibility**: markdown copies are generated by [`scripts/build_markdown_mirror.py`](scripts/build_markdown_mirror.py).
