# Context Model for `_IMPERATIVE_*` Corpus

## Scope
This overview models all files under:
- `undo_uus_archive/_IMPERATIVE_Article/*`
- `undo_uus_archive/_IMPERATIVE_Responses/*`

The material is an archival package about the conception, revision, review, production, publication, and reception of Undo Uus's philosophical position: **The Libertarian Imperative**.

## High-Level Structure
The corpus naturally groups into six connected layers:

| Layer | What it contains | Primary files |
|---|---|---|
| Core doctrine texts | Draft evolution from early manuscript to publication-ready text | `1b`, `2b`, `3b`, `4b`, `5b`, `5c`, `6b`, `6d`, `_TheLibertarianImperative.pdf` |
| Editorial workflow | Letters/emails with publisher/editors; revision guidance; logistics | `1a`, `2a`, `3a`, `4a`, `5a`, `6a`, `6c`, `6e`, `6g`, `6h` |
| Peer/intellectual input | Referee critiques and exchange with philosophers | mostly inside `4a`, `5a`, `3a`, and in response dossier |
| Related publication output | Book review commissioned during same process | `6f-LoweBookReview.pdf` (+ coordination in `6a`, `6e`) |
| Public-facing packaging | Journal/offprint covers and final article PDF | `_JournalCover.JPG`, `_OffprintCover.jpg`, `_TheLibertarianImperative.pdf` |
| Reception and argument audit | Compiled responses + Uus's meta-comments on whether argument was understood | `undo_uus_archive/_IMPERATIVE_Responses/Responses-to-Imperative.pdf` |

## Core Intellectual Content Model
Across versions, the same core claim persists:
- If free will is true, acting as free is correct.
- If free will is false and all behavior is law-governed, then believing/acting as free could not have been avoided.
- Therefore one should follow the **Libertarian Imperative**: act in accord with incompatibilist free volition.

Recurring conceptual clusters:
- Consciousness vs. materialism.
- Epiphenomenalism critique.
- Nomism/law-governed causality and its limits.
- Free will as methodological imperative, not just metaphysical thesis.
- Distinction from Pascal's Wager / William James style reasoning (developed more strongly in later versions).

## How the Files Connect (Process Graph)

| Stage | Inputs | Outputs / transition |
|---|---|---|
| Pre-submission preparation (1997) | `1a` (friend review request), early manuscript | `1b` original full paper |
| Initial publisher contact | `2a` (submission letters + first editorial reaction) | move to `2b` revision |
| Intensive editorial shaping | `3a` (Keith Sutherland guidance on tone, focus, structure, references; special issue planning) | `3b` revised manuscript |
| Referee intervention | `4a` (explicit reviewer report and Keith's concrete constraints) | `4b` significantly tightened manuscript |
| Second revision cycle | `5a` (discussion of referee feedback; later note that Sprigge/Kane comments were incorporated) | `5b` and style variant `5c` |
| Final acceptance + production prep | `6a` (Libet gives go-ahead; request for e-text), `6c` (pure text handoff), `6b` (TEX source), `6d` (clean text) | production-ready article text |
| Typesetting / publication operations | `6e`, `6g`, `6h` (proofs, schedule shift, corrections, author bio, copyright) | `_TheLibertarianImperative.pdf` + cover images |
| Parallel side output | request in `6a` and submission logistics in `6e` | `6f-LoweBookReview.pdf` |
| Post-publication reception archive | published paper + prior exchanges | `Responses-to-Imperative.pdf` compilation |

## Major Development Signals Across Versions
- Title narrows from **"The Libertarian Imperative and its implications for consciousness studies"** (early versions) to **"The Libertarian Imperative"** (later versions/final).
- Correspondence shows pressure to reduce polemical tone and remove/rework certain sections (`private honesty`, heavy closing implications).
- `4b` is notably shorter than earlier drafts, consistent with requested cuts.
- Later versions (`5b` onward) strengthen explicit treatment of relation to William James and Pascal's Wager.
- Production-stage edits include technical/cosmetic corrections (including postal code change to `61602` reflected in final published format).

## Timeline (Content Chronology)
- **1995**: Early argument formulation and exchange (van der Steen; captured in response dossier).
- **Mar-Jul 1997**: Manuscript circulation, first submission, substantial editorial coaching (`1a`-`3a`).
- **Sep 1997**: Referee report and structural critique (`4a`), new revision (`4b`).
- **Jan-Feb 1998**: Final revised submission to Ben Libet; positive gatekeeping outcome (`5a`, `6a`).
- **Dec 1998**: Electronic text transfer for typesetting (`6a`, `6c`).
- **Feb-Mar 1999**: Lowe book review delivery cycle (`6e`, `6f`).
- **Aug-Sep 1999**: Issue scheduling, proofs, detailed correction pass (`6g`, `6h`).
- **Oct 1999**: Article appears in regular JCS issue (per correspondence in `6g`).
- **Late 1999**: Reader/peer responses archived (`Responses-to-Imperative.pdf`).

## Principal Actors and Roles
- **Undo Uus**: author and reviser of core thesis.
- **Keith Sutherland**: JCS publisher; primary editorial gatekeeper and strategist.
- **Anthony Freeman**: managing editor; production and proofs workflow.
- **Benjamin Libet**: guest editor (acceptance gate in correspondence).
- **Joseph Goguen**: editor-in-chief referenced in acceptance path.
- **External interlocutors/commentators**: John Beloff, Piet Hut, Robert Kane, Timothy Sprigge, Steve Freeman, others cited in letters.
