---

We are in an epistemically difficult situation. On the one hand, it seems reasonable to believe that the world is thoroughly material: an enormous system composed of relatively simple physical elementary components—fields and particles—whose behavior is strictly governed by laws of nature. A large part of what happens in the world has indeed turned out to be explainable on the thesis that reality is, in its basic nature, physical.

On the other hand, we are aware of phenomena such as consciousness and freedom of the will, which do not fit into a materialist (physicalist) world-picture at all, because they disclose a non-trivial aspect of existence of the kind customarily called “supernatural.” Which picture of the world—materialist or non-materialist—is correct? This difficult philosophical question has troubled people since antiquity. Regrettably, science has lost its impartiality with respect to this most important problem and has begun to defend materialism passionately and even dishonestly, suppressing or denying the facts that call that worldview into question.

Modern science, recognizing only so-called objective research methodology and a materialist world-picture, has competently handled a very wide domain of natural processes, bringing about extensive scientific and technological progress. But having taken a one-sided stance toward the basic worldview problem, science ignores the extremely interesting nature of conscious phenomena and therefore fails to see new fundamental research directions that could already be developed very fruitfully. If science managed to free itself from its dogmatic narrowness, both its role as a primary force shaping human social development and its prestige in the eyes of the public would rise significantly.

There are arguments that point concretely to the shortcomings of the contemporary scientific worldview, but they rely on comparatively complicated concepts, so orthodox science has been able to neutralize them rather successfully. We should try to find easily understandable lines of reasoning that help us escape a one-sided perception of the world. The aim of the present essay is to present one such argumentation.

## The contemporary scientific worldview

The contemporary scientific worldview is materialism, or physicalism. What does physicalism claim? First: that everything that exists is a vast configuration of relatively primitive physical entities—particles and fields. Physicalism denies the existence of immaterial components of existence that are independent of physical reality. Second: that the behavior of any material object or system—whether the dynamics of a simple atom or the functioning of an extremely complex brain—is ultimately determined by fundamental laws of nature, i.e., laws of physics. Physicalism denies the existence of a freedom of will that does not submit to nomic necessity.

Physicalism is sometimes portrayed as a foolish worldview by attributing to it positions it has never actually advanced. Therefore it is necessary to clarify what physicalism does *not* claim. Physicalism does not claim that reality contains no aspects that are not themselves physical. It claims only that all non-physical “things”—mathematical structure, information-processing, psyche, etc.—can exist concretely only insofar as they are borne by physical reality. Physicalism does not require that every object and system in the world be called “physical.” It claims only that all objects and systems that exist in the world are physical in their basic nature, in the sense that however complex they may be, they are nonetheless composed of the same physical basic components—electrons, protons, neutrons, etc.—as simple physical bodies.

Physicalism does not claim that the supreme aim of science must be to describe all processes in the world using only the basic equations of physics. It claims only that even the lawfulness governing the functioning of the most complex systems is ultimately determined by the fundamental laws of physics to which the interaction and dynamics of the physical basic components (fields, particles) of those systems are subject. Reducing higher-level laws to the fundamental equations of physics does not mean abolishing those higher-level laws, but showing how they follow from the fundamental equations.

Physicalism is a worldview free of logical contradictions; it is simple and elegant in content, and easily understood.

## The modern conception of scientific methodology

The methodology of scientific research has been shaped so that it is suited precisely to the study of a world as described by physicalist philosophy. This methodology rests on two principles.

First: because physical objects and phenomena are in principle observable by anyone, it is required that scientific facts be publicly checkable, i.e., objective. Second: because physical reality is accessible to human cognition only to the extent of its formal or abstract structure (even if, for example, the essence of an electric field were a pain sensation, we could not detect that in any way), the theoretical method for dealing with real phenomena is considered to be the analysis of formal structures and their dynamics—thus, of spacetime structures—i.e., mathematical analysis.

Although obtaining objective scientific facts can be technically extremely difficult, and mathematically describing and analyzing the formal structure of reality can be enormously complex, objective-scientific methodology is simple and unproblematic in its essence. Objective facts are reliable: they are public and inspectable by anyone. Structural concepts are readily discussable because they are communicable between persons: it is possible, for example, to explain to everyone what a square is. The epistemic scheme of analyzing objective phenomena is trivial: there is some observed structure (empirically obtained structural information), and one must determine the peculiarities of that structure—for example, the presence of some order in it—or else posit a hypothesis of a more fundamental structure of which the observed structure is a manifestation.

What makes this epistemic scheme trivial is that in the course of analysis one manipulates structures that do not include the analyzing activity itself: the activity does not belong as a component to the analyzed structure even when one is studying, by objective-scientific means, the functioning of one’s own brain.

## The one-sidedness of contemporary research on reality

Objective-scientific research methodology is one-sided both in the domain of facts and in the domain of concepts.

Facts about the contents of an individual’s consciousness are not objective in the sense that other individuals cannot check them. A being’s sensations, emotions, etc. are directly known only to that being; other subjects’ knowledge of them is indirect and hypothetical. For this reason, for example, it is impossible for us to know what it is like to be a bat (Nagel 1996). The lack of collective access to subjective facts does not make them any less factual than objective facts. Yet contemporary science ignores subjective facts—or even obscurantistically denies their existence (Dennett 1991).

We are aware not only of the formal structure of our conscious states, but also of the qualitative content of the components that constitute those states—colors, sounds, smells, tastes, pains, fatigue, sadness, joy, etc.—that is, qualia (Latin *qualia*). The essence of qualia is not some structure, but a concrete non-structural qualitative content: for example, red and blue differ not by structure but by their structureless specific nature—their phenomenal quality. As non-structural entities, qualia are not mathematically describable. Therefore, the canonized methodology of scientific research does not employ the concept of qualia and does not even wish to acknowledge the possibility of such a concept.

Qualia are not merely “formal indices,” being nothing more than either identical or different: they are rich in content. The rich content of sensory and emotional qualities, and their influence on behavior, cannot be understood by logical-mathematical analysis—structural thinking—but requires a different kind of intellectual activity: quality-thinking (Uus 1994: 40–99). Contemporary science does not use quality-thinking and does not even speak of the existence of such a kind of intellectual analysis. By ignoring subjective facts, non-structural concepts, and quality-thinking, science fails to use the very valuable information about the properties of reality that is contained in the qualitative character of subjective facts.

## The impasse in consciousness research

In the interpretation of orthodox materialist science, phenomena of consciousness are certain brain processes (see Crick 1994). This interpretation is unconvincing. Sensations and the interior of the brain are too different to be regarded as identical.

Qualia characteristic of conscious states cannot be found in the brain. For this reason, consistent materialist philosophy denies the existence of qualia. Recently, however, the position of consistent materialism has weakened significantly: there are already quite a few scientists and philosophers who acknowledge the existence of immaterial consciousness and qualia (see Chalmers 1995). During this process of rehabilitating consciousness, an odd situation has emerged. While acknowledging the immateriality of consciousness, many still cling to the thesis of the causal closure of physical reality, i.e., the view that the cause of a physical event can only be physical. As a result, they are forced to claim that consciousness is causally ineffective, i.e., an epiphenomenon (Chalmers 1996).

Thus, trying on the one hand to remain faithful to common sense and on the other to physicalist dogma, they throw logic aside. For how could we report the existence of our consciousness if it had no effect at all on our behavior? The fatal flaw of epiphenomenal theories is that they sever themselves from any empirical basis. Consciousness research is at an impasse because, not daring to abandon the thesis of the causal closure of the physical world, consciousness is treated as a phenomenon that has no influence on what happens in the world. To escape this impasse, we must acknowledge the causal efficacy of consciousness.

## Possible mechanisms of conscious causal influence

Consciousness can be causally effective in two very different ways.

Consciousness may be an immaterial field of some kind that interacts with the physical world (via the brains of conscious beings), so that together they constitute a combined physico-mental reality whose dynamics is subject to some set of laws of nature. Such a physico-mental joint world is of the same type as a purely material world, in the sense that its dynamics, too, is fully governed by laws of nature.

The second possibility for consciousness to be causally effective would be for it to be the basis or milieu of voluntary (free-will) activity.

## First option — the world as a physico-mental joint reality

This first possibility is logically unproblematic, but there are no facts in its support. Surprisingly, there is considerable reason to believe the second possibility—consciousness as the basis of voluntary activity—despite the fact that the concept of free will is “supernatural,” difficult to analyze, and logically problematic.

## The free will problem: libertarianism and compatibilism

The aim of this article is to justify that we are warranted in trying to behave as if we believed ourselves to have free will, by means of which our consciousness is causally effective. For this we must consider the problem of free will.

The term “free-willed” (Estonian *vabatahteline*) is used to denote two very different properties. Traditionally—and this is still the common-sense usage—freedom of the will has been understood as the ability to choose one course of behavior among many possible ones, as the ability to say: “I could have done otherwise than I actually did.” Freedom of will in this strong sense is incompatible with causal determinism, because determinism excludes an individual’s ability to do otherwise than they in fact do. Such an incompatibilist, libertarian freedom of will is beyond natural causality.

A second, more contemporary tendency is to use the term “free-willed” to denote a being’s autonomous functioning, free of external compulsion and constraint. Freedom defined in this way is compatible with the complete causal necessity of behavior. A decision is “free” in this compatibilist sense simply because it is *one’s own* decision, however rigidly it may be determined by one’s internal state.

In this essay, by “free will” I mean an incompatibilist, libertarian free will that does not submit to laws of nature. To emphasize this, I write the terms that refer to libertarian free-volitional activity with an initial capital letter.

## A scientific and logical argument against Free Will

According to the contemporary scientific position, human behavior is determined by the material brain. In all well-studied cases, the dynamics of material systems has turned out to be either deterministically or statistically law-governed, and from this a general conclusion has been drawn about the universal validity of physical laws. In the view of a typical contemporary scientist there is not the slightest reason to doubt that the brain is anything other than a complex machine, consisting of an enormous number of components that all operate in complete accordance with the laws of physics (see Minsky 1986). The principle “I could have done otherwise” is said to be a philosophical illusion that should be discarded (Dennett 1984b). Voluntary behavior is claimed not to occur in our world because its existence would violate the causal closure of physical reality.

In fact, it has by no means been established that brain dynamics is determined purely physically. It is still only a hypothesis that, similarly to other physical systems, the brain is not associated with properties of non-physical origin, including the capacity for Free-Volitional behavior. But we know that the brain is associated with one type of non-physical phenomenon, namely phenomenal qualia—unlike (as is commonly believed) simpler physical systems. Why, then, should it be inappropriate to think that the brain, unlike simpler physical systems, may also be associated with another non-physical phenomenon—Free Will—which in addition fits well with phenomenal qualia, whose hedonic aspects (pleasantness, unpleasantness) place behavior in an ethical context? The scientific argument against free will is, in any case, disputable.

Free Will is also often denied on the basis of logic. It is claimed that a Free-Volitional act, as an act with no causal basis, would be a random event, and that what happens randomly cannot be determined by a free choice. Choice is said to be only of two kinds: either causal or random. The notion of a Free-Volitional agent is considered logically contradictory or, at best, mystical. But this logical argument, too, can be challenged (Wiggins 1973). The claim that every event is either causally determined or random is not an obvious logical truth as it seems to be. The obvious logical truth is that every event either is causally determined or is not causally determined. Logic does not require that a causally undetermined act must be a random act.

## Phenomenological evidence for Free Will

Every individual with Free Will has an irrefutable proof of their ability to choose between different alternatives: the feeling of freedom. The sensation of volitional effort is not merely different from other sensations like pain, warmth, fatigue, etc.; it has a specific qualitative content such that, in experiencing it, it is evident that volitional efforts are free in the sense that it would have been possible to refrain from them. That is why common sense finds it absurd to complain that one’s own volitional efforts never “go past” one. Thanks to immediate phenomenological evidence of having Free Will, an individual’s being a Free-Volitional agent is for that individual an indisputable empirical fact, not a speculative hypothesis.

Unfortunately, in the present philosophical climate it is not at all ridiculous to claim, as Dennett (1984a) does, that those who say they know they have performed acts they could have performed otherwise, in exactly the same situation, must admit that they proclaim this supposed empirical fact without the slightest proof and without the faintest hope of ever obtaining such proof.

It is asserted that libertarian Free Will is an illusion, merely a deceptive feeling that cannot be taken seriously. There are two main reasons why contemporary educated people do not regard the information contained in the quale of the feeling of freedom as true. First: experiences of volitional effort are not publicly inspectable, nor is their qualitative content communicable between persons; i.e., they belong to private reality, and people are trained to regard everything subjective as extremely doubtful. Second: the specific capacities for quality-thinking that are indispensable for analyzing the qualitative content of sensations are not needed for contemporary objectivist scientific work, and therefore these capacities are ignored or even ridiculed.

Although phenomenological evidence for Free Will is usually dismissed on dogmatic grounds as conflicting with belief in the universality of natural causation, even many libertarians tend to think one cannot seriously claim we can know introspectively whether we do or do not have Free Will (see Van Inwagen 1983). The higher-order mental processes required to apprehend phenomenological evidence for Free Will may indeed be much easier to distrust than simpler intellectual procedures. Therefore it would be a great fortune if it were possible to reason about Free Will on the basis of much simpler concepts than phenomenal qualia. Such a possibility exists.

## A neglected approach to the free will problem

Philosophers have analyzed in fairly detailed fashion two aspects of the free will problem: the conceptual aspect—what Free Will means and whether it can exist in a deterministic, law-governed world—and the epistemological aspect—how we can know the truth about the existence of Free Will in the world.

But a third important aspect has been entirely neglected: the praxeological, or behavioral-scientific, aspect—on the basis of what belief about one’s own Free Will one ought to behave. It is true that in the overwhelming majority of cases, praxeology depends directly on epistemology: the claim that things are such-and-such is taken as the basis for reasonable behavior when there are empirical data or theoretical considerations in favor of the view that things really are such-and-such. But in certain special cases, praxeology separates from epistemology and acquires logical priority over it. Then a certain view can be taken as the basis of reasonable behavior solely because of the specific logical structure of the situation, independent of any knowledge of whether that view is correct or mistaken.

The ideal limiting case of all such situations is the unique situation of facing the problem of one’s own free will. The free will problem has a non-epistemic praxeological solution, because we can apply our possible Freedom of Choice even when we do not know whether we have it.

## Formulating the Libertarian Imperative

The Libertarian Imperative is an answer to the question: “On what stance regarding the possession of Free Will must reasonable action rest?” It is therefore a normative requirement, whose reasonableness depends on the overall aims of behavior. In formulating the Libertarian Imperative I assume that the ultimate principle of a person’s conduct is absolute honesty, which excludes any deliberate lying.

I call the following requirement the Libertarian Imperative:

One must always try to act in accord with the thesis that one possesses libertarian Free Will.

Some comments. The Libertarian Imperative says nothing about whether Free Will is in fact possessed. One must follow this imperative even if one knows one’s behavior has always been deterministic. Apart from the justification of the imperative itself, the effect on one’s action of following this imperative is equivalent to having knowledge that one is a Free-Volitional agent.

The point of posing the Libertarian Imperative is that the claim “We must try to behave as if we knew we have Free Will” can be justified much more simply than the claim “We know we have Free Will.”

## Justifying the Libertarian Imperative

To understand the explanation of why the Libertarian Imperative must be followed, one needs to understand only two simple concepts: one basic concept used by science—what “law-governed dynamics” means—and one common-sense concept—what it means, in the most everyday practical sense, to “try,” to “attempt.”

In general it is not hard to understand what law-governed dynamics is, but much confusion arises from understanding one of its subtypes—the deterministic decision-process in choosing among alternatives—which is most closely connected with the free will problem. It is claimed that determinism does not exclude making choices, but usually it is not understood that deterministic choice is fundamentally different from Free-Volitional choice. Free-Volitional choice is free in the sense that the individual could have chosen a different alternative than the one actually chosen. Deterministic “choice,” by contrast, is not a choice among real alternatives.

This fact is expressed very clearly by Minsky (1986: 306). According to the contemporary scientific view there is no room at all for “human freedom of will”… everything, including what occurs in our brains, depends on and only on: a set of definite deterministic laws of nature; a set of purely random events… Whatever action we may “choose,” it cannot bring about the slightest change in what would have happened anyway—because the strict laws of nature had already produced the mental states that caused us to decide in that way. And if the choice was made partly at random, that still leaves us nothing to decide.

Yet many philosophers muddy this problem, trying to create the impression that there is no important difference between deterministic and Free-Volitional choice. Their aim is to protect materialism from the threat posed by people’s introspective knowledge that they have Free Will. People ask: “How can my will be free if I cannot make choices other than those I actually make?” and they regard deterministic choice as a pitiful imitation of freedom.

Various tactics are used to pass deterministic choice off as genuine choice. Some claim that deterministic decision-making is not dull rule-following because the rules themselves can evolve as the system functions. Others think an organism escapes the influence of physical laws because it is a unified whole whose parts behave in a coordinated manner. But however “dynamic” or “holistic” a deterministic process may be, at its basic level its course is always determined by the “blind” following of fundamental rules—laws of nature.

Dennett (1984a) defends compatibilism very ingeniously. Not believing in the existence of libertarian Free Will, he redefines the meanings of the words and expressions traditionally used in discussing free will—inevitable, possible, unavoidable, open future, can, could have done otherwise, decide, free choice, free will, etc.—giving them a “useful” content that is applicable only within the domain of law-governed dynamics. Then talk about complex law-governed functioning sounds like ordinary talk about Free-Volitional activity, provoking few objections from naive common sense. And, more importantly, further reasoning about the free will problem is made impossible, because now there are no longer words for the relevant concepts—the language has been amputated.

But on closer inspection, Dennett’s attempt to please common sense while remaining faithful to physicalism ends in failure. Acknowledging that we rightly fear constrained situations in which freedom of choice has narrowed to a single option, he offers us two kinds of “open future”: an epistemic one (being ignorant of what will inevitably happen) and a probabilistic one (having dynamics that is in part stochastic). To be free, on this view, is to be either ignorant or at the mercy of blind chance—thus, Dennett believes, we can have free will without contradicting science.

If a person’s behavior is deterministically causal, then at every moment they have only one behavioral possibility—this is what determinism means. The deterministic decision-process is fixed in every detail and therefore the decider cannot prevent its unavoidable outcome. If a person’s behavior is partly probabilistic, then they also produce purely random acts. Without violating the probabilistic law of dynamics, it is in principle possible to behave in many different ways, but only on the condition that the statistics of the actually produced behavior has the character of blind chance that satisfies the law. Consequently, if a person’s decision-making and other behavior is subject to laws of nature, the person cannot prevent its deterministic or purely random occurrence.

To understand what “trying,” “attempting” means in a plain, pre-theoretical sense, one must understand what one must do to obey commands such as: “Try to raise your hand”; “Try to say: ‘Physicalism is mistaken’”; “Try to imagine a circle”; and so on. This presupposes that one has the practical ability to produce volitional efforts of various directions. It does not presuppose knowledge of the brain processes (or “soul processes,” if any exist) that occur in connection with acts of willful trying.

The reason we must always try to act as if we knew ourselves to be Free-Volitional agents—even when we do not in fact know this—is very simple. I think most people are subconsciously aware of this reason. I will now state it in a clear form.

Our volitional efforts are either nomic processes that, at some fundamental level of description, obey deterministic or probabilistic laws of dynamics, or they are Free-Volitional acts that, at no fundamental level of description, obey laws of nature.

If our volitional activity is nomic, then: (i) if we claim that our activity is nomic, we are right; and (ii) if we claim that our activity is Free-Volitional, we are wrong—but our being wrong is unavoidable, because then we cannot prevent our behaving in that way.

If our volitional activity is Free-Volitional, then: (i) if we claim that our activity is Free-Volitional, we are right; and (ii) if we claim that our activity is nomic, we are wrong—but our being wrong is not unavoidable, because as Free-Volitional agents we could have behaved otherwise, i.e., we could have claimed that our activity is Free-Volitional.

Therefore, in order to behave in the epistemically most reasonable manner with respect to the free will problem, we must always try to act in conformity with the thesis that we are Free-Volitional beings: because if we actually are Free-Volitional beings, such attempts accord with the truth; and if we actually are not Free-Volitional beings, then our attempts are not the kind of acts that could make the course of things in the world either better or worse than it otherwise would be—because then those attempts themselves belong to nature’s causal network, and their law-governed occurrence, whether deterministic or random, cannot be prevented.

One may view the Libertarian Imperative as an invitation to experiment: let us not speculate whether Free Will is theoretically possible; let us not ask whether there are known empirical proofs for or against the claim that we have Free Will; let us solve the practical side of the free will problem experimentally—let us try to act as if we knew ourselves to be Free-Volitional beings, and see whether it succeeds. This kind of experimentation has an absolutely certain safety mechanism: if it is doomed to fail, it harms nothing, because in that case the experiment cannot be carried out at all.

## On the metaphysical possibility of free will

Although the possibility of Free Will is not a precondition for justifying the Libertarian Imperative (for, as I have just explained, following the imperative is reasonable even in a rigidly deterministic world), it is still appropriate to take an interest in whether free will is logically thinkable at all. This question is topical because there is a seemingly reliable logical argument against the possibility of Free Will.

It is claimed that freedom cannot exist in any possible world, because an action that is not caused by previous states of the world could have no reason and would therefore be random; but events that happen randomly are not Free-Volitional acts. The libertarian stance—that a choice is Free only if it is not causally determined by prior events—is regarded as vague and obscurantist, if not internally contradictory.

I try to counter this metaphysical argument in two ways. First, I emphasize that the inability to provide an easily understandable definition or explanation of the concept of Free Will is not decisive evidence for the inconsistency of that concept. Second, I draw attention to the fact that the concept of natural causation is not even in the simplest type of physical causality simple, and is rather close to the concept of agent-causation used to explain the nature of Free-Volitional activity.

Many aspects of reality and their concepts are simple and therefore easily understood. Sameness, difference, natural number, linear sequence, flat space, lawful order, randomness, etc. are relatively simple, low-order concepts. But there are also higher-order concepts such as infinity, time, consciousness, Free-Volitional activity, omnipotence. Such concepts cannot be reduced to low-order concepts. This irreducibility must not be taken as a sign of inconsistency in higher-order concepts. There are generally accepted concepts that cannot be explained in a simple way; and the failure of attempts to explain them has provoked mistaken conclusions, as if those concepts were inconsistent.

Consider an example. The concept of actual existence is easily understood. But if we try to explain what time is, we must also use the concept of past-existence. Not everything that belongs to the past exists actually, i.e., in the way what belongs to the present exists. Yet the past is not a fiction. Some philosophers claim there can be no third possibility between actual existence and non-existence, and therefore time cannot have the feature commonly taken to be characteristic of it: that only the present exists actually, whereas the past no longer exists and the future does not yet exist. They claim that time is like space and that all of its moments/points—past, present, and future—exist actually “at once,” in exactly the same way. But there is no reason to infer from the irreducibility of the higher-order concepts of past- and future-existence to the low-order concepts of actual existence and non-existence that the traditional concept of time, which is intuitively well understood, is inconsistent, and that therefore only space-like continua can exist.

Analogously, there is no basis for inferring from the irreducibility of the higher-order concept of Free-Volitional behavior to the low-order concepts of law-governed and random dynamics that the common-sense concept of Free Will, which is intuitively well understood, is inconsistent. The requirement that all basic aspects of reality must be categorically trivial is not justified. A longing for a world that is simple in its basic nature must not blind us to the point that we begin to deny our most refined intellectual capacity—the capacity to understand intuitively the content of higher-order concepts.

Those who defend the view that the concept of Free-Volitional behavior is inconsistent because the only clearly graspable behavioral variants are said to be either causal or random, assume that the concept of causal dynamics is simple. They have hardly ever taken an interest in what causation actually means and how it is metaphysically possible.

The objective natural sciences investigate only the spatiotemporal and other formal structure of the world, i.e., its abstract form, not its content (see Russell 1927: 163; Carnap 1969: 19, 28, 107). The primary task of science is to discover laws of nature—universal regularities in the structure of the world—whereas the question whether those laws are sustained by supernatural forces, by the nature of material substance, or by something else is a matter not for science but for metaphysics. Assuming the laws hold as they do, knowledge of how their holding is “guaranteed” has no pragmatic value. To satisfy metaphysical curiosity, one is advised to rely on a “principle of economy”—seek the simplest causes first—and to adopt the belief that the causal order of the world is guaranteed by material substance itself. Since fundamental physical laws are relatively simple, people regard such belief as reasonable. But they do not take a serious interest in how a causal process could work.

Let us ask the question. The simplest kind of causal chain can be pictured as follows: there is some state of affairs S1 at time t1.

Because of causation, a moment later, at time t2, S1 brings about the state S2.

How could this happen? Does S1 cease to exist at time t1 and S2 arise out of nothing at time t2, so that cause and effect are temporally separated? Hardly. Rather, it is reasonable to assume the causal process is continuous: the state S1 *becomes* the state S2. If we admit that change is something more than merely having different parameter values at different moments—i.e., that the rate of change itself is a characteristic of the state—we arrive at an intriguing conclusion. If the transformation of a state from S1 to S2 is determined purely logically by the state’s rate of change, then causation in its substantive sense (as regards the physical causal “activity” of material substance itself) consists in one aspect of the state—its rate of change—being determined by other aspects of the state at that very moment. All basic equations of physical dynamics express precisely this sort of dependence, because both sides of those equations refer to the physical situation at one and the same moment. Substantive causation consists not in the present being determined by the past, but in the present self-determining independently of the previous situation.

Does this sound like “vague and frantic” libertarian metaphysics? If someone claims the libertarian concept of a creative agent who can contribute to the world independently of previous causes and conditions is vague or mystical, then they must admit that the ordinary concept of causation must also be regarded as “vague.” It is useful to be aware that even the most traditional concept of causation is not trivial and resembles the libertarian concept of agent-causation, according to which Free-Volitional agents partially self-determine their character independently of their earlier properties and are the first causes of their deeds. Libertarian Free activity is not as radically different from natural causal process as it may seem at first glance. Causation may be compatible not only with deterministic choice but also with Free-Volitional choice.

## The lack of private honesty can hinder scientific progress

The Libertarian Imperative can be viewed as the following exhortation: let us not speculate whether Free Will is theoretically possible; let us not ask whether there are empirical proofs for or against our having Free Will; let us solve the practical side of the free will problem experimentally—let us try to act as if we knew ourselves to be Free-Volitional beings, and see whether it succeeds.

How might an anti-libertarian respond to an invitation to participate in such an experiment? The anti-libertarian may grant that the Libertarian Imperative is indeed one of the basic principles of truth-seeking behavior. They may even concede that they are in principle capable of performing any specific behavioral act required for following the imperative: for example, making various statements in defense of libertarianism; performing various operations in scientific research aimed at determining which physical laws are violated in the functioning of the brain; and so on.

But they might claim they are unable to support libertarianism in any systematic way, because they are a system with law-governed dynamics whose “program” is fortunately immune to the “brain-computer virus” called the Libertarian Imperative. The assumptions of the Imperative do not exclude the possibility that they might be right. But are they right? This raises the problem of private honesty.

Suppose some ingenious scientist has constructed a device to demonstrate that a certain previously accepted physical principle does not hold universally. If, at a critical moment in the experiment, one presses a control button, a novel result appears; if one does not touch the button, nothing remarkable happens. Scientists are invited to verify personally that the unusual event really occurs. Now suppose that most scientists, feeling great reluctance to renounce their adopted views, do not press the button at the right time, but claim they did and insist the experiment yielded no new results. How can their honesty be checked? In that case one can appeal to impartial observers to watch whether the button is pressed.

But what if such public control is impossible? This is precisely the case with volitional efforts: only the person who is supposed to be trying to exert volitional effort can know whether they actually do so. For brevity I call honesty regarding things that are publicly accessible (checkable) *public honesty*, and honesty regarding things that are only privately accessible *private honesty*.

There has been surprisingly little fraud in scientific research. The professional ethical level of natural scientists has been kept exceptionally high because all steps of objective scientific research (observations, experiments, theoretical speculation) are publicly inspectable—this is one of the fundamental requirements of the methodology of the objective sciences. Honesty regarding things investigated by objective science is invariably public honesty, subject to effective intersubjective control. Since this is generally known, people are convinced that human moral imperfection cannot spoil scientific enterprises, even though it has often ruined many other undertakings.

But this may no longer be so. If conscious beings have Free Will, then genuine progress in consciousness research is possible only if we follow—and then we can follow—the Libertarian Imperative, acting in accord with the thesis that our brain dynamics is substantially Free-Volitional. But if, in such a case, scientists, while understanding the justification of the imperative, deceitfully claim due to lack of private honesty that they are not able to act as is appropriate for persons with free will, progress in consciousness research is blocked.

Moreover, if living beings have Free Will, then the most fundamental direction of scientific activity is the investigation of everything connected with voluntary behavior; and in that case scientists’ private honesty becomes one of the most important preconditions of scientific progress. If we are Free-Volitional individuals, our scientific self-investigation is as poorly protected against our moral defects as our coping is in many other spheres of life.

## Peculiarities of the Libertarian Imperative

The justification of the Libertarian Imperative is easy to grasp. This is because what is justified first is not the attempt to affirm that one’s own behavior is Free-Volitional, but the attempt to deny that one’s behavior is law-governed (inevitable); and the concept of law-governed dynamics is much easier to understand than the concept of Free-Volitional activity.

This kind of justification is analogous to proofs by contradiction: some theses can be proven by showing not their truth directly but the impossibility of their alternatives being true. The simplicity of the Imperative’s justification can even create the impression that it is a cheap sophistical trick.

The Libertarian Imperative applies only to oneself. From the logical form of its justificatory schema it can be seen that it can be used only in a very limited way—only for justifying those volitional efforts occurring here and now that attempt to treat those very efforts themselves as instances of Free-Volitional acts. The logical basis of the Imperative does not permit me to justify my attempts to regard my other acts of will as Free-Volitional—let alone the behavior of other individuals.

The Libertarian Imperative is ontologically general in the sense that it commands one to try to deny not only the universal physical (materialist) determination of one’s behavior, but any kind of complete determination whatsoever—whether purely spiritual, or caused by some supernatural (demonic, divine) force, or anything else.

The Libertarian Imperative is not an epistemic claim: it does not assert that we *know* ourselves to have Free Will. Yet because the Imperative requires us to try to behave on the thesis that we have Free Will, following it is, in its consequences, equivalent to adopting the belief that we know ourselves to have Free Will. In that sense, the Imperative has the force of an epistemic claim.

## Scientific generalizations of the Imperative’s recommendation

Strictly speaking, the Libertarian Imperative justifies only a given action’s “belief” that it is itself Free-Volitional. Any claim about a wider scope of Free-Volitional behavior cannot be justified by pure logic; it can only be motivated scientifically and hypothetically—and that is what I will do next.

Since I am justified in regarding some of my acts of behavior as Free-Volitional, I am also justified in regarding myself as a Free-Volitional being and therefore it is appropriate to be interested in the extent to which my activity is Free-Volitional. It is scientifically reasonable to try to determine which kinds of my activity are at the disposal of my Free Will. Provisionally—but fairly reliably—I can assume that those of my actions are Free-Volitional that involve a felt volitional effort, because it is quite evident that the Free-Volitional nature of volitional efforts is manifest in the qualitative content of those efforts.

Since other persons are comparatively similar to me in physical constitution and behavior, it is natural to think that all people’s activity is Free-Volitional to roughly the same extent. From the standpoint of each person, it is scientifically very reasonable to generalize the Imperative’s recommendation into the hypothesis that all people are Free-Volitional beings. Similarly, it is reasonable to suppose that many other individuals—especially those of higher biological species—also possess Free Will.

## A peirastic rejection of materialism

The Libertarian Imperative requires that we try to refuse to accept any philosophical conception that claims we are thoroughly law-governed functioning creatures. Given the contemporary scientific-philosophical situation in the world, the most topical ideological implication of the Imperative is the demand to discard natural-scientific materialism as a mistaken worldview.

Such a rejection of materialism, if we succeed in it, is not epistemic: it does not rest on knowledge that our behavior is not determined by laws of nature. One may call such setting-aside of materialism *peirastic* (English *peirastic*, from Greek *peirastikos*: experimental, endeavoring), because it is based on the practical success of a behavioral strategy aimed at discarding materialism, and is logically justified on the grounds that if the success of such behavior is guaranteed by our Free Will, then in rejecting materialism we are right; and if the success of such behavior is the result of our physically law-governed functioning, then we were forced to act in that way so as not to violate the law-governed materialist character of the world’s dynamics.

The Libertarian Imperative requires us to abandon the materialist worldview together with its specific influence on scientific research programs.

## Implications of the Imperative for science

Acting in accordance with the Libertarian Imperative, we must acknowledge that physical reality is not causally closed. We must assume that the fundamental laws of physics are violated to a significant degree in the brain. One of the main objectives of brain research must be declared to be determining which physical brain processes are brought about by volitional efforts: how Free Will modifies—by violating physical laws—the functioning of the brain’s neural network.

Such research would be of the most fundamental importance among all scientific undertakings conceivable today, because whereas until now the main aim of the natural sciences has been thought to be the discovery of universal regularity in the behavior of the world—laws of nature—the object of these new kinds of investigations would be a “supernatural” phenomenon: the influence of immaterial consciousness and Free Will on the dynamics of matter.

From our ability to realize behavior sought by our Free Will very reliably—despite the brain’s functioning under conditions of comparatively high hydrodynamic, chemical-biological, and thermal noise, and despite its lack of shielding from electromagnetic disturbance fields—it follows that the physical effects induced by Free Will that guide neuronal-level processes are not very weak, and therefore may be relatively easy to discover.

Investigating brain processes brought about by Free Will is not only the task of neurologists but also the duty of those scientists working in scientific fields that can contribute effectively to researching this most intriguing natural-scientific problem. Much help should come from the technically and intellectually powerful science of physics. After all, the problem of the causal efficacy of Free Will is directly connected with the question of the nature and fundamental properties of physical reality.

Unfortunately, enthusiasm for the achievements of the physicalist sciences has shaped an intellectual atmosphere very hostile to non-materialist views. Therefore it is psychologically painful to obey the voice of reason and honestly follow the Libertarian Imperative: there is complete reason to fear the destruction of one’s scientific reputation. It is also extremely unpleasant to renounce positions one has enthusiastically defended.

## APPEAL TO SCIENTISTS: SO AS NOT TO HINDER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCIENCE, LET US DISCARD MATERIALISM AND PROMOTE LIBERTARIANISM!

Understanding that belief in the correctness of natural-scientific materialism, together with a lack of private honesty, can today strongly inhibit the development of science, I feel obliged to make the following appeal.

Dear scientists:

Contemporary science is loyal to the physicalist worldview, which may nevertheless be mistaken due to its inability to explain conscious phenomena. If consciousness and will are, as common sense believes, causally effective immaterial entities, then belief in materialist doctrines blocks the most important scientific research.

So as not to obstruct a possibly very important scientific and spiritual progress, let us earnestly and responsibly try to renounce the natural-scientific materialist worldview and promote libertarianism:

because such efforts are justified not only if we truly possess Free Will, but also if our functioning is entirely law-governed—since in that case any actual acts of behavior of ours, however reasonable or unreasonable, are particular manifestations of nature’s law-governed causal order and therefore had to occur unavoidably so as not to violate that order;

and because if we remain faithful to materialism, we risk—since we may in fact possess Free Will—that we will accurately act out the behavior of purely material, highly intelligent hypothetical beings and defend anti-libertarian claims ingeniously precisely thanks to our immaterial consciousness and Free Will—thus spitting into the well from which we drink, and strongly hindering the development of science.

We have nothing to lose, but we may gain immensely, if we can free ourselves from materialism and become libertarians.
