# markdown-reader

This folder contains **human-edited reading editions** of selected archival materials.

## Purpose

- Optimize readability and conceptual clarity for messy or heterogeneous sources.
- Make clear, reader-friendly structure (letters, commentary, marginalia) where the generated mirror can be noisy.

## Policy

- Originals in `undo-uus-archive/` remain canonical.
- `markdown-mirror/` remains script-generated and reproducible.
- `markdown-reader/` is curated by human judgment and may contain interpretive formatting (e.g., reflow, headings, grouping).
  Readers who need archival certainty should verify against the originals (and, where present, `markdown-mirror/`).
