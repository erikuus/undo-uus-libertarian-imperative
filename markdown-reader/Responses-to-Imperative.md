### T1-M1 — 1995-08-12 — U. Uus → Wim J. van der Steen

The idea of the argumentation is to defend the thesis that it is reasonable to believe that free will exists, by relying not on the understanding and use of the concept of free will that is a high-category concept and hence quite difficult to comprehend, but on the understanding and use of the concept of lawful dyna mics that is an easily comprehensible concept and one of basic concepts used by modern natural sciences. And here is the argument itself:

I understand that it is reasonable to try always to believe, and to base my behavior on the assumption, that I am a free-will creature, because:

(a) if I am indeed a free-will being then I am right;

(b) if I am actually not a free -will being, so that my brain functioning, my beliefs, and my behavior have been determined by laws of nature (be they deterministic or probabilistic), then I am wrong, but then these beli efs and behavior could not have been avoided by any means, because the avoidance of them would have required the violation of these laws of nature.

The crux of this argument lies in pointi ng to the fact that if the dynamics of the world is thoroughly non-free-will, then one's belief into, and defence of, (in this case) fallacious free-will thesis could not have been avoided by anybody or anything. Therefore this argument advocates experimen tal (empirical) rather than theoretical (speculative) attitude towards the free -will problem. Instead of speculating about whether I possess free will or not, I will try to behave free-volitionally and see whether I will succeed or not. And, in fact, always when I have had to express my opinion about the free-will problem, I have been able to d efend the free -will thesis. Now it may, unfortunately, be so that I will try, and it will seem to me that I succeeded, but then science eventually discovers that this success was an illusion and that actually my behavior was determined by laws of nature. But then at least I did my best in trying to control my own behavior, and the failure is not my fault: nobody can violate the laws of nature if they hold necessarily.

Dear Undo Uus,

I much enjoyed reading your article on 'The Libertarian Imperative' and I very much hope that the Journal of Consciousness Studies will have the good sense to publish it.

As I understand it, you are not claiming to prove that we ARE free. You are just arguing that we have a moral obligation to act as if we are free agents [U.U.: my emphasis]. And you point out that nothing that science can tell us contradicts this assumption.

I have no objections to raise with regard to anything you say in your article but I would like to point out that you could strengthen your case if you were to invoke the evidence for PK [U.U.: PK=psychokinesis].

[… omitted in source …]

Please let me know what response you get from the editors of the JCS.

Again, many thanks and all good wishes.

Yours..............John Beloff

Dear Undo:

I am sorry that it took me more than a month to find the time to read your paper on "The Libertarian Imperative".

I very much like your overall direction and intention. I completely agree that the problem of free will is fully overlooked in most discussions of the ability of science to 'cover' the physical world. You have presented your arguments clearly.

### T4-M2 — (referee report) — forwarded by Keith Sutherland

I've read "The libertarian imperative and its implications for consciousness studies," and am of two minds -- but in balance feel I have to recommend resubmission.

On the one hand, I think it is certainly an interesting piece of work, occasionally obscure, but usually straightforward, well written and to the point. I am in great sympathy with many of the ideas it touches on. They are, I think, crucial but rarely discussed, and are right up JCS's alley. I especially like the early sections running from _Dennett's Dictum_ through _The unjustified denial of the ph enomenological evidence for free will_. For me, the most important point here is its (much too brief) direct attack on "the 'scientific' dog ma of nomism -- the view that the world is *thoroughly* law governed". The logic of the standard arguments against free will, as Uus' summary in the first part of the paper shows, hinges on the nomist assumption; once introduced, I thought that an a ttack on the nomist assumption would be the point Uus was going to develop. I was surprised that it was raised only to be passed over quickly, and it turns out to play a fairly minor role in the overall argument. My reaction here might be suspect: ever since r eading a draft of what was to became Chalmers' book, I have been convinced that what Uus calls the nomist assumption is at the root of much confusion in consciousness studies, and needs a very careful and very critical look. I think that given the first pa rt of the paper, the natural continuation would be to focus on the shortcomings of this assumption. At the very least, the reader should hear more about the objections raised by Eddington and Sherrington.

My problem, then, is that while I find the treat ment of The Libertarian Imperative in the second half of the paper to be good in isolation, it seems to me a weak continuation of the exposition that lead up to it, and to be rather obliquely related to consciousness research *per se*. It is almost as if the second half of

the paper were written independently, and then a long introduction related to consciousness were attached later as a sort of sustained after-thought.

The treatment of the Libertarian position in the second half of the paper seems to me to be closely related to the logic of Pascal's Wager or to William James' stance toward free-will: "My first act of free will is to believe in free will." The James sort of argument justifies free will on pragmatic/psychological grounds. It would be helpful for Uus to spell out the relation of his proposal to these classical positions with which he seems, on the surface, to have much in common.

I feel there are really two papers here, with only the first half directly related to consciousness, and that t his part should be fleshed out for re-submission. The second half could easily stand on its own without any specific consideration of consciousness, and the force of the second half of the paper, if *only* co ncerned with the questions about consciousness a nd free will raised in the first half, could be adequately conveyed in page or two. There is also a problematic change of "stance" (can't think of a good way to put this) between the first half of the paper (which more or less takes up a natural science p erspective) and the second half (which shifts to a very different mode of argument, one that is at once pragmatic and narrowly logical). My own feeling (again, perhaps being a hostage to my own views) is that the nomist assumption is at the heart of the matter, and that if possible it is best attacked directly, and within the scope of standard methods of scientific reasoning. Uus just started to do this, but then abruptly moved to a very different "stance" in his argument for the Libertarian Imperative. From the standpoint of JCS (as distinct from a philosophy journal), it is the development of the first half of the paper that holds the promise. In the event of a decision to re -submit, I have some relatively minor stylistic and expositional points that might be of help.

A number of the authors in the JCS special issue on the Volitional Brain (Aug/Sept) make reference to the poli tical implications of the free will debate. David Hodgson is well known for his argument that our Western system of law and ethics requires that we accept a libertarian approach to free will, and this is reinforced by Undo Uus follow -up paper [my emphasis, U.

Dear Dr. Uus,

Thank you for your letter of 21 April, and the enclosed article on free will. I agree with virtually all of it. I liked your argument that we should seek to avoid avoidable error, and that therefore we should try to believe in free will. However, I think the mainstream response might be that the argument assumes an incompatibilist view of what it means to be able to do otherwise. There is a vast philosophical literature on whether free will is compatible with determinism. As appears from the Introduction and Section 4.4 of a book I have just written (enclosed), I think compatibilism is sophistry - but many people disagree.

With best wishes,
Mev oe
David Hodgson

- Date: Sat Dec 27 23:33:26 1997
- From: rkane@uts.cc.utexas.edu (Robert Kane)
- Subject: paper and book

Dear Professor Uus,

………………………………………………………..

On free will, we agree of course that free will is incompatible with causal determinism--and that is a crucial agreement --but I don't think it follows that "incompatibilist, libertarian free volition transcends natural causality."(p. 4 of your article) I think this is one of our deepest disagreements (one worthy of continuing discussion). I think free will is compatible with probabilistic caus ation (though not of course with deterministic causation). There are reasons of course to think that if fw is subject to probabilistic causality, fw would be ra ndom. But while this may seem so, I think is not ultimately so and I tried to show why in my book by bringing in quantum physics, non -equilibrium statistical mechanics, chaos and complexity theories and neural network theory in my a ccount of free will. (I am engaging in a lecture series next semester on these to pics with my colleague Ilya Prigogine who as you know is a pioneer in some of these sciences.) Of course you also (if I interpret you correctly) think that these new developments in science make room for free will as never before and you rightly and persuasively criticize deterministic interpretations of current phys ical and biological sc ience. But like Popper, Eccles, Hodgson et al. you think they make room for the intervention of an immaterial mental element and I am not ready to go that far. (I should add that I don't oppose mind/body dualism b ecause I incline to atheism or reductive ma terialism. Indeed I am a religious b eliever (a Christian), and my defense of libertarian free will has religious as well as purely philosophical motivations. But I am not yet convinced that mind/body dualism is necessary for religious belief or for libertarian free will.)

Your discussion of the libertarian imperative in your paper is quite original and challenging. I agree with the imperative, but I would add something to my reasons for agreeing with it -- having to do with the fact that we need to think of ourselves as having libertarian fw because we need to think of ourselves as having ultimate responsibility for our actions if life is to be fully meaningful and libertarian fw is needed for ultimate responsibility. (This pivotal role for "ult imate responsibility" should be familiar from having read my book.) (Perhaps you will not necessarily disagree with this addition?) Your example of the e xpedition on the alien planet (p. 9 of your paper) is ingenious and I agree with it to this extent: in t he absence of conclusive empirical evidence one way or the

other on whether we have free will, it is rational to obey the imperative since without it life lacks significant meaning and acting in accord with it may lead to finding that it is true. (But I wo uld not add that acting in accord with it is a necessary condition for finding out it is true (bottom paragraph, p. 13) This caveat is perhaps connected with the disagreement about whether we can know we have fw by introspection?)

We agree again of course on the "metaphysical possibility" of fw (p. 10) though I think we would give different reasons for it. Indeed as I step back to get an overview of your writing, my impression is that we agree on many things about fw, and further all our disagreem ents, such as they are, seem to go back, one way or the other, to disagreements about mind/body dualism as they impact on fw. Perhaps I am wrong about this, but it seems to be the case.

In any event, I immensely enjoyed reading your work and learned a great deal from it; and I look forward to reading anything further you have to write.

Yours sincerely,
Bob Kane

- Subject: The Libertarian Imperative

Dear Undo Uus,

I read with pleasure your article in the October issue of the Journal of Consciousness Studies and I was flattered that you saw fit to cite an article of mine in your References.

I was already familiar with your book BLINDNESS OF MODERN SCIENCE which you once very kindly sent me. Would I be right in concluding that you have somewhat softened your position since then? In your book you claimed that "Freedom of Will is an empirical fact that falsifies the modern scientific world view" whereas in the present article you base your position on pragmatic grounds, namely that: "one must always try to act in accord with the thesis that one has the libertarian free will." I think I prefer your new formulation.

You argue, plausibly, that belief in free will is justified in much the same way as Pascal's belief in God. The analogy is striking [my emphasis, U.U.] although I am not so sure that Pascal could justify his position. What sort of a God would it be, after all, who rewarded those who worshipped him for purely precautionary reasons? I am reminded here of a remark by Bertrand Russell who was asked once what he would say if, after death, he came face to face with his Maker? He replied, coolly: "I would say: Lord you did not give me sufficient evidence"! Russell's position strikes me as more dignified than Pascal's.

With all good wishes.

Yours....................John Beloff

### T8-M2 — (note) — Undo Uus (re: Pascal’s Wager comparison)

[U.U.: In my article (p. 59) I state :

"My defence of the Libertarian Imperative is not, ho wever, of Pascal's Wager type. My logic of reasoning may seem to be closely related to the logic of Pascal's Wager because I stress a truism that the Free Will issue is not an u n-

important minor problem that doesn't deserve serious attention. But here the resemblance ends. There are two essential differences between my a rgumentation and Pascal's Wager type of reasoning. (1) Pascal's Wager type of reasoning consists in weig hing gains and losses of alternative decisions, and its conclusions depend on how large or small are those gains and losses, and how reliable is our assessment of them. Such reasoning is of game-theoretical type. My argumentation is not of game-theoretical type. Its conclusion doesn't depend at all on how large or small are gains and losses of alternative decisions, or whether there are any gains and losses at all. (2) Pascal's Wager type of reasoning can be applied for making decisions about a very wide class of alternatives: we use this kind of reasoning quite often in our everyday life. My scheme of argumentation can be applied extremely r estrictedly: only in the case of one very particular kind of problems. The pro blem about one's own Free Will is one of them due to its unique logical structure. One is not asked to choose whether he b elieves or not that God exists, or that people have immaterial so uls, or that there is afterlife, etc., but one is asked to choose whether he believes or not that he is able to choose. Just owing to this self-referentiality present in the task it is possible to solve it by purely logical means."
---
It appears that those differences should be explicated more forcefully and clearly than I did in my article.]

<a id="t9-m1"></a>
### T9-M1 — 1995-04-07 — U. Uus (to/for Timothy L. S. Sprigge)

Timothy L. S. Sprigge

Uus [7 IV 1995]:

Suppose I have to answer a question whether I am a freewill agent or not. I may respond in three different ways. I can answer either that: (a) I am not a freewill agent, or that (b) I am a freewill agent, or that (c) I do not know whether I am a freewill agent.

If I claim that I am not a freewill agent, then: (a1) if I am not a freewill agent, I am right; (a2) if I am a freewill agent, I am wrong and can be
blamed for my erroneous answer, because:
(a2.1) if it is rather easy for me to learn that I possess free will (e.g. by introspective analysis of my volitional efforts), then I have been intellectually inadequate to reach this knowledge, and as a freewill creature am myself greatly responsible for this my intellectual inferiority; (a2.2) if it is very difficult or even in principle impossible for me to learn that I possess free will, then the best answer to the posed question would have been that I do not know whether I am a freewill agent, rather than asserting unjustifiably (and erroneously) that I do not have free will, and as a freewill agent I could have withheld from such unreasonable answer.

If I claim that I am a freewill agent, then: (b1) if I am a freewill agent, I am right; (b2) if I am not a freewill agent, I am wrong but nobody can accuse me or my erroneous answer, because then all my activity is determined by (deterministic or probabilistic) laws of dynamics of reality and by my construction, which itself is determined by these dynamical laws on the basis of the initial state of the universe, and therefore solely the laws of nature and the initial state of the universe (or the Creator of these laws and state) are responsible for what happens, while I cannot not obey these laws and have not had shaped the initial state of the universe.

If I claim that I do not know whether I am a freewill agent, then: (c1) if I am not a freewill agent, my answer is fatalistically determined, and hence nobody can blame me for such an answer (in fact, this argument is the same as (b2));

(c2) if I am a freewill agent, then, because I cannot rule out the possibility (the possibility (a2.1)) that I can rather easily learn that I possess free will, I cannot rule out also the possibility that I have been intellectually inadequate to reach this knowledge, and as a freewill agent am then myself at least partly responsible for my intellectual inferiority.

Hence, when asserting either that I am not a freewill agent, or that I do not know whether I am a freewill agent, there is a risk of exposing my intellectual inferiority, for which I myself can at least partly be blamed. But when claiming that I am a freewill agent, I am either right, or I am wrong but then my wrong claim has been determined by the laws of nature (be they physical or mental) and by the initial state of reality (be it physical or men tal), and thus could not have been avoided by any means -- I had no possibility to do otherwise -- and therefore only the laws of nature and the initial state of the universe can be blamed for this my wrong answer. Consequently, if my tongue will ever bend to produce an utterance (or my hand an inscription) `I am a freewill agent', it is reasonable to respond just this way to the question posed: in this case I am e ither right or I am wrong but then could not have answered otherwise.

I should like to emphas ise that the reasoning behind such decision is based not upon one's understanding what free will is, but upon understanding what f atalistic dynamics (functioning) is. Therefore the presented argumentation should be understandable also to those persons who suspect that the dynamics of the world may be thoroughly fatalistic (non -free-volitional), and thus I think that if they are able to utter `Yes' when asked whether they possess free will, they should find it reasonable to answer just this way. Of course, t here can be pe rsons who will assert that their tongue will not bend, try as they can, to utter `Yes' in response to the question if they have free will (I do not believe such claims, however, like I do not believe the claims by materialists that their exp eriences are devoid of phenomenal qualia), and these persons will not follow the recommendations I proposed. But for me it is an empirical fact that I have hit herto been always able to give an affirmative answer to the question about the freedom of my volit ion, and as long as my tongue will bend to shape such a nswer, I will always answer just this way.

### T9-M3 — 1998-02-11 — U. Uus → Timothy L. S. Sprigge

[You think that]

Uus [11 II 1998]:
In your opinion (p. 6) I think that it is pointless to try to avoid unavoidable wrongness. This is not true. My position is that it is impossible to avoid unavoidable wrongness, and as far as I understand this position cannot be challenged because this is what `unavoidable' means. I don't hold that acts of trying (conscious intentions) are epiphenomenal in a deterministic world; I merely maintain that if some act of trying did not actually take place in a deterministic world, then it could not have taken place. You reject the premiss that nomically functioning beings cannot act othe rwise than they do (p. 6). This claim surprises me because in my opinion the proposition `nomically functioning beings cannot act otherwise than they d o' expresses plainly one basic aspect of what nomical functioning means. I try to explain. A behavioural act is contained in the process of one's transition from a pre act state S1 to a post-act state S2. If one is a deterministic creature, this transition is a lawful causal transition S 1→S2. Distinctive to deterministic causal trans itions is that if we fix S 1, then the entire transition S 1→S2 would also be uniquely determined, because this is what determinism means. If a deterministic cre ature is in a conc rete state S 1, he can undergo only one particular transition S1→S2, which means that if he had in fact made the transition S 1→S2, he could not have behaved in some other way, i.e. he could not have acted otherwise than he did. A lifelong behaviour of a nom ically functioning creature can be described as a temporal series of transitions between his successive psycho -physical states, i.e. as S 1→S2→S3→S4→S5→ and so on, and in no point on this ‘trajectory of

life’ — at no moment in his life — can he, on his own initiative, deviate from it, or move along it with a different velocity than he is bound to do according to psycho-physical laws of dynamics.
---
If I tell mathematicians, ‘If 1+1≠2 then (1+1) ∙ 3≠6’ they will probably r eply, ‘This counterfactual conditional is true, but as the counterfactual antecedent is false, your claim doesn't make much sense.’ If I tell my fellow astronomers, ‘Had the comet Shoemaker -Levy changed somewhat its velocity a few months before crossing Jupiter's orbit, it would not have collided with Jupiter,’ they will probably answer as follows: ‘Your cou nterfactual conditional is perfectly correct, but the antecedent of the counterfa ctual is nomically impossible, for the comet could not have changed its velocity as this is prohibited by the laws of nature. Why talk about the course of events that is obviously not possible?’ And let us now think of the situation where a child, in a determini stic world, carries out some mathematical operation incorrectly, because he did not listen carefully enough to the teacher's explanation. Suppose that we both are a kind of Laplace's Demons able to observe and theoretically predict in every detail the psycho-physical dynamics of conscious creatures in the deterministic world, and that we were considering, some time before the lesson, the behaviour of this child. Although the child's psycho -physical dynamics are very much more co mplicated than the movement o f a comet, it is, in the deterministic world, as d etermined and, in principle, as predictable as the movement of a comet. If I had then said to you, ‘The child can avoid the mistake, because if he listens carefu lly enough to the teacher's explanation, he will not make the mistake,’ you would have got probably quite surprised and contended: ‘You see, we both know pe rfectly well that, given that the present total psycho -physical situation in the world is as it in fact is, the child could not, and would not, listen to the teacher, unless the psycho -physical laws that have been held hitherto would be broken. The child will make the mistake nomically necessarily, and therefore he cannot avoid the mistake.’ If my volitional activity is, and has always been, nomic, then, if I maintain that my activity is Free -Volitional, I am wrong, but I am wrong nomically ne cessarily, having been, in principle, unable to prevent my being wrong.

[However, I never responded. I was tired of repeating over and over, to no avail, the arguments of the kind: "If I don't have free will, I could not have had thought harder about the matter than I actually did".]

### T10-M1 — 2002-07-29 20:58:45 +0200 — Alexander Batthyany → Undo Uus — Subject: The Blindness of Modern Science

- Subject: The Blindness of Modern Science

Dear Dr. Uus, a few yedrs ago, John Beloff of Edinburgh recommended your book "The blindness: of Modern Science" to me. I didn't really follow this up, but recently I came across your highly interesting article on "The libertarian imperative" in an 1999 issue of JCS. Your article really and finally arose my interest in your book and work. I'd therefore like to ask where and how to get a copy of your book (since, according to amazon.com, it is either out of print or rather hard to find) « I am very much looking forward to hearing from you and remain, with kind regards,

Alexander Batthyany
