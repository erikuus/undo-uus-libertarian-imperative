# _IMPERATIVE_Responses

This folder preserves the original post-publication response dossier.

## Contents

- `Responses-to-Imperative.pdf`: compiled responses and related commentary tracking how the argument was interpreted.

## Why It Matters

The dossier is essential for historical analysis because it shows reception quality: where readers understood the argument's logic and where they conflated it with other free-will positions.
